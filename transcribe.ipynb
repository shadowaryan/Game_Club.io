            "[{'prompt': '', 'completion': \" Welcome guys! In this video, we will be taking a look at the top 20 best weapons in this game. So I tested each and every weapons performance and made this list, and also it's based on my three years of experience in PUBG Mobile. Anyway, this weapon analysis is based on 2021 January 8th, and PUBG can either nerf or buff the weapons in upcoming updates. So the numbers can change in future but currently, at the number one spot, we have MK14. Surprisingly the MK14 always been on number one spot in my last two videos as well. The main reason why the MK14 is the most powerful weapon in this game is because of its damage. It has a base damage of almost 61, which is the highest in any fully automatic weapons. Anyway, let me explain you how the vests and helmets will give you protection. For example, level one vest and helmets will give you 30% protection, meaning that they will reduce the damage by 30%. Similarly, the level two vest and helmet will give you 40% protection, and the level three will give you 55% protection from the base damage, and MK14 only requires four bullets to take down the opponent. Doesn't matter what type of armor the opponent is using, just four bullets are enough. Every time I fight against MK14, there is a higher chance of me losing the fight. Sometimes it can shoot without making any sound after first shot. By the way, that's a glitch which is another advantage for that weapon. Moving on to the MK14's recoil, higher damage comes at the cost of higher recoil. So MK has the highest damage in any fully automatic weapon, so it will also have the highest recoil in the game. Anyway, MK14 has only two attachment for reducing the recoil, muzzle and stock attachments. For the muzzle, compensator is the best, and for stock, cheat pad its main purpose is for single tapping. Just for comparison, we are comparing MK's recoil next to AKM fully attached to see how it looks. It looks like the vertical recoil is almost close, but however, the horizontal recoil is way higher. You absolutely need to run MK14 with its full attachments, otherwise your sprays will look like this. But exactly how powerful is MK14? In terms of numbers, it has 668 damage per second, which is the highest in this game. Anyway, there are three situations in time to kill calculations. One where all the bullets hit the upper chest area, and another one where all the bullet hits the headshot, and lastly, one shot is a headshot, and rest all hit the upper chest. And the time to kill calculations are also the lowest, making the MK14 the most powerful weapon in this game. Being the most powerful weapon doesn't mean it doesn't have any downsides, its main disadvantage is that its magazine size, limited to 20 rounds per single spray, this can actually get you killed in some situations like this. At the number two spot, we have Groza, an air drop exclusive weapon. Groza is the most powerful assault rifle in this entire game specialized for close range fights. Anyway the Groza and AKM have the same base damage, but Groza can shoot 20% faster than the AKM, and 18% faster than the barrel. Here is the damage chart for Groza, and remember AKM and MK47 Mutant also has the same identical damage. Moving on to the Groza's recoil, just for comparison, we are comparing Groza's recoil next to AKM and barrel to see how well it compares next to them. Surprisingly Groza has the lowest recoil among all the 7.62 assault rifles, and if you want to run this weapon for mid-range, you could do that easily, because Groza's recoil comes really close to the M4. The best thing about this weapon is that it doesn't require any attachments rather than a suppressor and extended mag. Anyway, suppressor doesn't affect the recoil that much, so it doesn't matter, but how powerful is Groza exactly? It has a deep PS of approximately 600, and you know what, Groza is the only weapon that can outperform MK14 in terms of time to kill, but only when your opponent is wearing level 1 or level 2 vest and helmets. So why Groza isn't on number 1 spot because it can outperform MK14 in some situations you might be thinking, well, MK14 is a weapon that is really good at all the ranges like close to mid and long range, while the Groza is specially made for close range, so that is why it's not on number 1 spot. At the number 3 spot, we have another air drop exclusive only weapon the M249. I'm sure everyone had argued with your teammates about who gets to keep this weapon. Everyone likes to use this weapon because of its magazine size, which is 100 rounds that's more than enough to wipe out an entire squad without reloading in between. Everyone will recognize this weapon by its sound, and they will be afraid to take a fight against you, especially because the amount of damage it can do to your opponents. With this weapon, you can easily blow up the vehicles and kill the entire squad instantly. I mean the amount of damage it does, just take a look at the damage chart, it has slightly more damage than the 5.56 assault rifles like M4 and others, but the thing is it can shoot 20% faster than them. So let's take a look at the M249's recoil patterns, it feels a bit difficult to spray with M249 at mid range. And also let's compare it next to M4 and AKM to see how well the M249 performs in terms of recoil. By looking at this results, the M249 has the low vertical recoil, but however the horizontal recoil, I don't know what to say about that, but it looks really hard to control it, but the first 10 bullets of M249 have low horizontal recoil, so I would suggest if you ever had to spray with M249, try to take down your target in first 10 bullets, otherwise the horizontal recoil is really challenging to control. Coming at the number 4 spot, we have AWM, the deadliest bolt action sniper rifle in this game, of course its air drop only weapon, so it will have some special skills, for example, it's the only weapon that can one shot kill the opponent with an instant headshot, here is the damage for the AWM it has the overall highest damage in the entire game. Quickly following up at the number 5 spot, we have the M24, another bolt action sniper rifle, but its main disadvantage is that it's not as powerful as the AWM. Anyway, here is the damage chart for that weapon, by the way, the M24 does 5% more damage than the car 98K, and if you want to know more about the differences between car 98 and M24 check out my weapon comparison that might help you. So at the number 6 spot, we have car 98K, some people prefer to use this weapon because of its sound, but technically the M24 is a better weapon than the car 98K, and they both have the same thing in common, they both cannot destroy the level 3 helmet in one shot. At the number 7 spot, we have the Uzi, the fastest firing weapon in this game, so let me tell you few best things about this weapon, it has the very low recoil, in fact its lowest in any fully automatic weapon, but the damage is also low, since it can shoot two times faster than most of the weapons, damage isn't a big deal. Anyway, here is damage for all the vest and helmets, pause the screen and take a closer look to understand how many bullets you need to hit in order to kill the opponent. The main reason why I'm putting Uzi to this list is because of its rate of fire, Uzi can shoot two times faster than most of the other weapons, this makes the Uzi one of the most powerful weapons in close range. If you play a lot of solos then you must take Uzi, but however, in squads, there is a big disadvantage for Uzi, Uzi can only take down one enemy at a time, if multiple enemies comes at the same time, there is a higher risk of you losing against them, because you are only limited to 25 to 35 rounds which is fine since Uzi can shoot two times faster, you might run out of ammo after killing one enemy, so Uzi is not a weapon that can be used against multiple enemies at the same time. I mean Uzi is so powerful in one versus one fights, you always win with this weapon, but if suddenly another enemy shows up, you might end up dying like this. So how powerful is Uzi exactly? It has a DPS of approximately 540, which is more than average of most of the weapons, and the time to kill results are really good, especially because it's under 0.4 seconds. At the number 8 spot, we have G36C, quickly following up at the number 9 spot, M416, and then at the number 10 spot, Auge 3, the main reason why I'm ranking all these three weapons together is because they are very similar, all the 5.56 assault rifles have the same damage, and also the same rate of fire. Anyway, here is the damage for all the 5.56 assault rifles, including Scar L and QBZ. But what makes G36C a better weapon than the M4 and Ogg? Well it's the recoil pattern. G36C has almost straight lines when we compare it next to M4, G36C may have higher vertical recoil, but it has completely no horizontal recoil, making the G36C a better weapon for spraying from mid to long range. And I also compare it Ogg's recoil next to M4, being an air drop exclusive will have its advantages, so Ogg has better spraying patterns and less recoil than the M4, but not good as G36C. The reason I put Ogg at number 10 is because it takes one extra second to reload the weapon when we compare it next to M4 and G36C, and that can cause some problems in close range fights. Anyway moving on to the number 11 spot, we have DBS shotgun it's currently the most powerful shotgun in this game, and it was an air drop only weapon few months ago but not anymore. But the way how a shotgun works is when you fire, it will hit 9 bullets or 9 shells of shotgun bullets, and each bullet will do a certain amount of damage, in case of DBS. Here are the damage chart. Anyway, it's really hard to determine how much damage you do in a single shot, because out of 9 shotgun shells you most likely to miss few, and also here is the damage for vest and helmet, and this totally depends on how many shotgun shells will hit the enemy out of 9. Shotguns have the ability to one shot kill the opponent instantly in close range fights, and this makes the DBS one of the deadliest weapons to use in extremely close range fights. But if you miss your shot, you will be at a massive disadvantage. Anyway, shotguns are only good in early games, as soon as the players start to get level 3 helmets and vest, shotguns ability to one shot will lose. Shotguns will do less damage against level 3 enemies, so it's not going to be powerful in end game situations. Quickly following at number 12 spot, we have S12K, another shotgun, but it's a semi-automatic shotgun, S12K has 5% less damage than DBS, 5% isn't a big difference, because S12K can still one shot kill the opponent just like DBS. Now at the number 13 spot, we have DP28, it's a very popular weapon well known for its high damage output with really low recoil, so the DP28 has almost the same damage of AKM, and here is the rest of the damage information about DP28. But also while maintaining high damage, it has almost the same recoil as M4, maybe better recoil controlling than the M4. But there are some downsides for this weapon, it sure does have almost the same damage of AKM, but it shoots 10 to 15% slower than an AKM, that's how it was able to achieve that low recoil, but also it's an LMG meaning reloading takes a lot of time, and your movements will be slower and stuff like that. DP28 is really a great weapon for mid to long range, it has a DPS of approximately 430 which is low, but with low recoil, you can easily take down the enemies from far. At the number 14 spot, we have QBU which replaces mini 14 in Sandhawk, and the amount of damage it can do, surprisingly, it does more damage than an SKS which uses 7.62 ammunition, while the QBU uses 5.56 ammo. Anyway here is the damage information for QBU, but in other maps, QBU isn't available since it's Sandhawk exclusive only, so mini 14 is actually gonna replace QBU in other maps, but mini doesn't have the same damage stats as QBU, but it does have very low recoil for single tapping. Coming at the number 15 spot, we have barrel M762 and assault rifle of 7.62 ammunition, in my opinion, barrel is a better version of AKM, even though it has 5% less damage than AKM, but it can shoot 15 to 20% faster than AKM depending on your FPS. Here is the full damage information for barrel, but the best thing about barrel is that if you put all the right attachments, it will have better recoil controlling the AKM, as well as the barrel gives you some customization with grips. This is the main reason, why barrel is on top of AKM. Anyway moving on to the number 16 spot, we have Tommy Gunn, or Thompson depending on what you call it. It's an SMG with really high damage of 42 a bit higher than 5.56 assault rifles, and here is the rest of the damage information, by the way, it takes only four bullets to kill your opponent if you shoot your opponent in either arms or legs. So that is quite interesting about this weapon, and always remember arms and legs doesn't get protected by helmet and vest. The downsides for Tommy Gunn are, you can only use red dot or holo sight scopes, but it's not a big problem, since it's an SMG, SMGs are not good in the mid to long range, because your bullets won't hit the targets due to the low bullet velocity. And the recoil of Tommy Gunn is very high, almost close to the M4, but it's okay since it has almost the same damage as an M4. And now to the number 17 spot, we have the vector, yes another SMG. The main reason why I put this weapon is because the vector is an overpowered weapon in 90 FPS, it outperforms any other SMG, and here is the damage info for this weapon. Now at the number 18 spot, we have desert eagle, it's a pistol, but not just any ordinary pistol, it has really high damage of almost 62, it can take down your opponent in less than four shots, doesn't matter what type of helmet and vest your opponent is using, it just destroys. Here is the damage information, so you will better understand how powerful is this pistol exactly. By the way it does more damage than MK14, at the number 19 spot, we have the AKM, it's still one of the most powerful weapons because of its damage, and here is the full damage information about AKM. I mean the AKM is a great weapon to use in early games, it doesn't require as many attachments as barrel. Everyone likes the AKM iron site, it's the best iron site in this game. Now to the number 20 spot, finally we have the Scar L, a 5.56 assault rifle, Scar L and M4 are very similar weapons, they both share same damage and the same rate of fire, so the stats will be very similar, but the problem with the Scar L is that it's recoil, it has very unpredictable horizontal recoil, in close range, it doesn't matter since it's easy to control recoil, but for spraying in mid to long range, you will definitely feel the difficulty in controlling recoil. Anyway, that's all for this video, I hope you learned something new, if you did hit the like button and subscribe for more upcoming videos like this, see you guys in the next video.\"}, {'prompt': '', 'completion': \" Welcome guys, this is one of the most anticipated video I ever got whether the iPhone is better or the Android In this video, I'll be comparing iPhone versus Android and we'll be going through the following tests as shown in the screen But for this comparison we'll be using an iPhone 11 2019's flagship versus the OnePlus 9 Pro 2021's flagship here are the specs for the device iPhone 11 has four gigs of RAM while the one plus has 12 gigs of RAM That's three times more and not just that the processor is also better in most scenarios But not by a lot and the iPhone is almost two years old But I'm pretty sure it can still compete against latest flagships because iPhones are very well optimized as compared to Android Let me show you what is optimization by opening the PUBG in both phones at the same time So we'll see which one loads up the game faster by looking at the specs of the devices The OnePlus has better performance so it should load up the game faster and it does complete the loading screen faster in the beginning But as the Android gets closer it's getting slower whereas the iPhone catches up and it even loads up significantly faster than Android The Android took four seconds longer to load up the game But loading into the lobby screen doesn't matter to most of you So let's check which one will enter into a game faster I will be entering into a cheer park training area which actually takes quite a long time to enter But let's check whether the iPhone will load up faster or the Android So after about ten seconds the iPhone loaded up the game first while the Android is still loading A few moments later Still loading One eternity later So after about 25 seconds the Android finally loaded the game and this is just 2019's iPhone Latest iPhones will make even bigger difference for example here I have the latest 2021's iPad Pro And it entered into the game within three seconds that's crazy fast While the Android took about 30 seconds to enter into the game So now I hope you understand how good is iPhones optimization Anyway now let's move on to the gyroscope comparison I have played on both iPhone and Android and when using gyroscope I noticed few things The iPhone gyroscope is more responsive or in other words it feels faster as compared to the Android But I actually wanted to show you exactly so I tried to measure or compare iPhones gyro with Android By stacking up both phones on a tripod but it didn't work At the end I found another way to show you the difference So here I have both phones crosshair pointed towards the same thing And I slowly started tilting both phones at the same time I paused the clip here and you can see that iPhones crosshair is slightly higher than Android That's because iPhones gyro is more responsive and it moves faster and quickly Here is another example right now the gyroscope is going downwards And if you look at Android screen it's slightly behind or slower next to the iPhones screen You can also pause the video to check the difference So the iPhones crosshair will reach to the tower first and then later Android's crosshair will reach to the tower So the Android gyro is slightly behind or delayed when compared next to an iPhone But the gyro delay isn't as big as you would notice in Oppo Vivo devices I would guess that iPhones gyro is approximately 10 to 20 milliseconds faster It could be more but I'm assuming it to be around 10 milliseconds Which is really really small difference barely noticeable to many people And another thing that I have notices that iPhones gyro will sink much faster What I mean by that for example when you sit in a chair and play with gyro The gyro will work just fine on both Android and iPhone But when you lay down in bed and play with gyro And Android it sometimes moves in opposite direction or takes some time To sink to your position whereas in iPhones The gyro will work just fine maybe sometimes it rarely happens So overall the iPhones gives a better gyroscope experience Moving on to the next topic, bullet registration Most people say iPhones bullet will register first So I tested this by shooting at almost the same time in the both phones And I ran this test for more than 20 times And the results were the iPhone winning most of the time So is it really true that iPhones bullets will register first? I mean it could be, it's really hard to test that Since iPhones are very well optimized maybe that's why they register faster But the bullet registration totally depends on your internet connection So I have no idea what to say here But there could be another reason And that is the touch registration Here is a fun thing to know iPhone 11 has 120Hz of touch sampling rate While the OnePlus 9 Pro has 240Hz to 360Hz touch sampling rate That's more than twice So technically OnePlus should register the touch first But in reality the iPhone with its slower touch sampling rate will register the touch first Suppose if you touch the fire button on both the OnePlus and iPhone at the same timing The iPhone will fire first Even though the OnePlus's hardware is capable of being two times faster It's not fully utilizing its true power Or simply in other words Android is not optimized Even if they want to optimize it would be extremely hard Because there are more than 1000 phones to be optimized Whereas on iOS there are only few phones And also every phone has a different specification For example ROG5 has 300Hz touch sampling rate And the Red Magic 6 has a 500Hz touch sampling rate And Lenovo Legion 2 Pro has 720Hz touch sampling rate And every phone has a different touch sampling rate So the game developers can't optimize each and every phone Because they can't even fix the bugs and glitches immediately So just like how iPhone's gyroscope is fast and more responsive In the same way the iPhone's touch is more responsive And faster than Android Anyway moving on to the next topic Will iPhones have less recoil than Android? Not really when comparing both recoil patterns from Android And iPhones side by side they look identical Here is the hipfire recoil comparison between Android and iPhone And the hipfire spread will be identical between Android and iPhone I mean the hipfire spread will be totally random every time But it looks identical in terms of recoil But why do people say iPhone has less recoil? Well there is only one explanation I have for that iPhones gyro and touch are very responsive Because of that it feels controlling recoil is easier on iPhone When compared to an Android phone Moving on to the next topic Amosist does iPhones have better Amosist? Well let's find out So here is the side by side comparison of Android and iPhones Amosist And the Amosist is identical in both It performs in the same way between Android and iPhone But why do people say Amosist works better on iPhone? Most people just think that If iPhone is better at few things Then it will be better with other things as well But in reality iPhone has only one advantage and that is optimization And maybe the other reason could be a smoother experience What I mean by that is iPhones will get constant 60 FPS Whereas on Android you do get 60 FPS But it's not stable it always fluctuates and drops a lot of frames And you will notice those frame drops and it's very annoying And it can affect your gaming experience iPhones will provide you with buttery smooth gaming experience So this could be a reason why the people think Amosist and controlling recoil is better in iPhones The only advantage I think Android has over iPhones is that 90 FPS But only few phones will support it And currently the OnePlus 9 Pro doesn't have support to 90 FPS So I have no idea what it's like to play in 90 FPS on Android But as far as I know Most of the player say Android 90 FPS feels like iPhone 60 FPS in terms of smoothness of gameplay But however upcoming iPhones will get 90 FPS option Soon the Android will lose its the only advantage Because Android 90 FPS vs iPhone 90 FPS Is literally like Android 60 FPS vs iPhone 60 FPS So as you know that iPhone will obviously get a constant and stable 90 FPS Whereas the Android always fluctuates between 90 to 50 FPS And now to the graphics comparison So here we have side by side comparison of graphics We have set the same graphics settings on both devices HDR extreme and colorful graphics So now you watch it and find out if there is any differences And let me know in the comments And now if you see the sun's reflection on vehicle doors The iPhone looks really good whereas on Android it looks kind of bad The textures aren't that good as you see on iPhone This could be a screen recording issue or maybe the graphics issues So the graphics looks identical to me But however if you look closer you would notice that iPhone renders houses slightly faster than Android It's like 50 to 100 milliseconds faster on iPhones But both has the same rendering distance and that is around 300 meters So in the final conclusion the iPhones are better than Android when it comes to gaming Especially on PUBG mobile iPhone has better touch response and better gyroscope sensors to get accurate sprays And most importantly stable and constant 60 FPS Which makes your gaming experience buttery smooth However iPhones are very expensive but you're paying for what you're getting Android would last only 2 to 3 years where the iPhones can last up to 6 years If you don't break it an Apple will provide software updates for more than 6 years And it gives you a better experience for everything overall But Android phones are affordable you can get it in any price range Where in iPhones you don't get that choice Anyway that's all I got for this video I hope you learned something new If you did hit the like button and subscribe for more upcoming videos like this And see you guys in the next video enjoy my bot gameplay I am a monster I just need to get it men I need to need The thing that I just painted out when we won't go see See my vision I've been unit I'm a killer I'm a fuckin doll Come in there I'ma play it now I'm a turd dog I'ma play the book I gotta go and get it man, I really just need it Tell these guys they can beat it I'ma get it, I'ma grab it man You never see that, I'ma make it mine I'm explosive like a mine I've been working every time Yeah, I do it on the grind, I'm a shy I'm a shy, yeah I'm be single today I'm a coldest competition Cause some goiss-hoes say Hey, I really go bustin' what's saying Yeah, I guess really ran through the pain But I'm just back at my path And I fixed it now, it's really okay So I ain't gonna waste And my chance to do my time So I'ma be a massive I'ma killin' this is my end, yeah I'm a dumbass Yeah, I am ready to fire I got a million, the sirens They just need to go achieve I just need to acquire So if I've been climbing up this ladder Yeah, some going up higher I need to do it till the day I'm a retire\"}, {'prompt': '', 'completion': \" Welcome guys, in this video, we will be taking a look at the one of the most controversial topic, and that is iPad vs iPhones. Many people say that iPads have a lot of unfair advantages against iPhone players, or basically any mobile players, so is it really true, let's find out. So starting with the first obvious and noticeable difference is the screen size, the iPad has bigger display, which means spotting enemies will be easier, since all the objects will appear bigger on the iPad, but not just that, the iPad will give you some extra viewing angle, that you normally won't get it on phones, which also known as iPad view. If you're wondering exactly how much extra view do you get with an iPad, for example this is iPhone 11 view, and now this is the iPad view. So now you can see it yourself on how much extra you can view with an iPad, and by the way, this is iPad Pro 11 inch model, other iPads may have even more extra view, or lesser view, but however with any iPad you obviously get the iPad view, which gives around 40 to 50% extra view. In my opinion I think the bottom view is least useful, but sometimes it can be useful in some situations. I've been playing on iPad for the past 20 days, and the top view was most useful for me, it can help you in a Ridge Fight situation. iPad extra view will allow you to see your enemy, before they see you, and having an extra viewing angle is always a better thing, sometimes you might get lucky with iPad's view. But most importantly in final circles, if you lay down, the extra view will be a huge advantage in this situation to spot other players in the grass. So what do you think, is this an unfair advantage against mobile players? Let me know in the comments, and in my opinion yes this is unfair, but actually no it's just an advantage, because iPads got a bigger display, and if they don't utilize that extra space on the screen, you'd get black bars like this. So this is why I call this as an advantage, so is it unfair, yes but actually no, but you also have to remember that extra view will require more rendering, and more processing power. In order to display that iPad view, since iPads are usually more powerful than mobile phones they can do that, moving on to the next thing, which is hipfire, many people say that iPads hipfire is crazy accurate, and that is true. As I said before, I started using iPads since last 20 days and I can feel that hipfire is so powerful in iPad, normally if the enemy is at 30 meters, or above I'd open the scope and fire, but with iPad I don't really need to open scope and fire, because hip firing is so reliable and powerful, and this is a huge advantage in close combat fights. Here is an example, the enemy is around 30 meters away or more, and you can clearly see how accurately I was able to knock with hipfire at this distance, normally in mobile phones, you wouldn't be able to do this with hipfire. So yeah, iPads have another unfair advantage in close range with this crazy accurate hipfire. Moving on to the recoil controlling, most people would say that iPads have less recoil, and you can spray easily at long distance. So is this really true, let's find that out, so I tested the iPads recoil and iPhones recoil pattern, and adjusted their sizes according to the aspect ratio, and compared them side by side, and they look identical, or very similar, but you might be thinking why iPads recoil goes left and right more often. Well, the recoil patterns or spray patterns are totally random, sometimes you get unlucky, and the recoil goes either left or right. It also happens on iPhone or any device, not just on iPad. So I did another test, but this time I compared the gap between each and every bullet, or the distance between each bullet, and compare it against the other one, and I did this few times. Sometimes iPhone gets lower value, sometimes iPad gets lower value, but they are very close, so I think the recoil is very identical, or basically the same random patterns. So why do people say it's easier to control recoil on iPad? Well, it's actually easier to control recoil on iPad because, on mobile phones, you get a smaller screen, which means you have less space for your fingers to move around, whereas on iPad you get, so much space to work around, because it has a bigger display. Bigger display means you can drag down your finger easily without any problems, and that's why it looks and feels like iPad has less recoil, but in reality all the devices will most likely to have the same recoil system. But on mobile phones you don't get that bigger area to control recoil as you would on iPad. So this is the reason why most people say iPad has less recoil. Moving on to the next one, which is Amocyst, so here is the Amocyst side-by-side comparison, between iPad vs iPhone. Anyway, the iPad was able to hit the enemy first, while the cross-hairer aim is at same level as the iPhone. So this means iPad has better Amocyst? I mean yes, but I can't be 100% sure that iPad has better Amocyst, however the reason why the iPad's hipfire is accurate is maybe because of the better Amocyst. So what do you think? Does iPad really have better Amocyst? So in the final conclusion, iPads has a lot of advantages against mobile players, most of them are unfair. But if you're thinking of buying an iPad to play professionally in tournaments, then let me tell you that iPads are not allowed on official PUBG mobile tournaments because of those iPad advantages, which would be really unfair for other players without an iPad. However if you want to play this game just for fun, or rank pushing, then maybe playing on a iPad would be okay, but most people would say it's unfair, and I totally agree with that. But iPad players cannot get a separate lobby like emulator players, because there are only 1-2% of iPad players, and if they get separate lobby, it would be filled with just bots, since there are not many players. So iPad players will most likely play in mobile player lobby, but however if PUBG could remove some unfair advantage like that hipfire accuracy and better Amocyst, then maybe it would be okay I guess, so what do you think? And also you can get iPad for really low price, while giving you same or better performance as an iPhone XS Max, you would get stable 60 FPS without any frame drops, there are also other models with different price range. And if you want to play on iPad will give you a better gaming experience than mobile phones, and there will be always one guy with an iPad in your friend list, who would most likely steal all your kills because of the iPad unfair advantages, and it gives overall a better gaming experience with stable 60 FPS. Anyway, that's all I got for this video, I hope you learned something new, if you did hit the like button, and subscribe for more upcoming videos like these, enjoy my bot gameplay, see you guys in the next one. Now I see the love of love to that life. Every time I try to breathe, I'm right, and carry me, for I love nothing. So I hope I can cope, and you should know that I know that, what's never gonna be so bad. So I'm gonna pack, go pack, oh, I'm gonna take you, I'm gonna pack, oh, I'm gonna try pack again. And once I pack again, when I drove down, while I played the worst thing I ever had, I think I could go. So I hope I can cope, and you should know that I know that, what's never gonna be so bad. So I hope I can cope, and you should know that, what's never gonna be so bad. So I hope I can cope, and you should know that, what's never gonna be so bad. So I hope I can cope, and you should know that, what's never gonna be so bad.\"}, {'prompt': '', 'completion': \" Welcome guys! In this video, I will show you how you can improve your aim and reflexes, or basically how to instantly aim at the enemy. This method will work for both the gyroscope players, and as well as non gyro players. Let's just assume this, as our target. So if you want to instantly aim like this, right on top of the target quickly, you just have to follow these steps. But the idea is pretty simple, you just have to get your crosshair as close as possible to the target and scope him, and then readjust your aim. In order to do that quickly, you just got to follow these steps. Step 1. Get your crosshair as close as possible to your target. Step 2. Scope him. Step 3. Correct your aim after scoping in, or adjust your aim after scoping in. If you do that quickly, this is how it should look. But you can do that even faster by combining steps, for example combining step 1 and 2, or combining step 2 and 3. What I mean is, if you scope him, it would take up to 0.2 seconds to completely scope him, so you could use that time to adjust your aim, let me show you an example. First, you have to scope in and then adjust your aim, or correct your aim. The moment you hit the scope button, you have to start adjusting your aim towards the target, in this way, you will not waste the scope opening time. This is the fastest way to aim directly onto the target, and you can achieve the maximum speed in this way. But this method works best when the target is close to your crosshair, otherwise, it wouldn't be fast and accurate. So in order to fix this issue, you just have to get your crosshair as close as possible to your target and scope him, while adjusting your aim. But you should always remember one thing, the moment you open your scope, you have to quickly adjust your aim as fast as possible. Here is an example from a classic match. So now the enemy has been spotted, and I need to get my crosshair as close as possible to the enemy. Once my crosshair is close enough to the enemy, I will open my scope, which means it will take up to 0.2 seconds to completely open the scope, so I will use that 0.2 seconds to adjust my aim from here to here, or basically correct my aim. So in this way, I will not waste any time. Even though the opponent started shooting first, I managed to take down the enemy by using this fast aiming method. Now to the training process. Just pick some random targets and start shooting at them randomly, but try to do it as fast as you can. The faster you do, the faster your reflexes will be. But I promise you that, spending at least 10 minutes each day practicing this fast aiming method, will eventually improve your reaction time and aiming skills. After about a week of practicing, you will create something called muscle memory, which will store all your movements and thing you do while playing including the bad movements. Everything will be stored in muscle memory, it will help you later to determine how much exactly you need to move your fingers or phone in order to aim right on top of the enemy. And now to the non gyroscope players, the fast aiming method is still possible, instead of using gyro, you need to use your thumb finger to move. I am not an expert in non gyro, so my movements will look slower, but you can achieve almost the same speed as a gyro player. The method is still the same, move your crosshair towards the target, once you're close enough, scope in and adjust the rest of the aim. But always remember to adjust your aim while scoping in, in this way, you will achieve the maximum speed. Anyway, that's all I got for this video. I hope you learned something new, if you did hit the like button, and subscribe for more upcoming videos like these. See you guys in the next one. Enjoy my bot gameplay. Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching. Just don't let us off my face at this time.\"}, {'prompt': '', 'completion': \" Hello and welcome to our Beginner's Guide to Valorant in 2022. We first made this guide a year and a half ago, but unsurprisingly, Valorant is a whole different game from back then, and as such, a new guide is much, much needed. So here it is. In this guide, we'll be covering all the essentials that every Valorant player must know in order to make a smooth transition into the game. So if you're a veteran player watching this thinking, but I already know most of these things, these are like the most important things you have to know in order to be good at Valorant. Well yeah, that's kind of the point, but if you're an intermediate player wanting to freshen up on the basics or a new one wanting to learn the game, this guide is just perfect for you. So make sure to like and subscribe and let's get right into it. The first thing we'll quickly go over is the game modes. The first two shown in the menu are unrated and competitive. Both of these two game modes are very similar, or essentially the same. The only difference being that the competitive will place you in a rank and cannot be played until you reach at least level 20, which will take quite a while. And in competitive as this is a ranked and rated game mode, over times which can happen if after 24 rounds no team is won will be a bit longer in order to be more fair. But more about that and the game mode itself later. Generally, this is considered to be the main game mode of Valorant and is the normal way to play the game. They have a primary objective which depends on your side and both of these have different objectives, which we'll talk about later. Both teams get 12 rounds on each side, or at least until one of the two teams wins 13 rounds total. The two sides are attacker and defender, which will go more in depth about in this mode later. Also in the lobby are two party game modes, one permanent one being Spike Rush and one being a rotating other game mode. Spike Rush is a faster variant of the normal game mode, with also a lot more chaotic aspects and wacky things happening all at once. Every attacker carries a spike, and orbs that have the potential to massively change the course of a round are spawned all over the map. People play this game mode to relax from the stress and pressure from normal games and play Valorant in a more chill setting. Other party game like I mentioned is rotational and changes over the course of the year, although currently it is escalation. That being a goofy deathmatch style party game where two teams compete to finish the arms race first. You'll start with standard guns like the Vandal and Phantom, but eventually you'll have to kill with Sova Shockdarts, Rez Boombots and other chaos inducing abilities. Perhaps it's not the best game mode to practice, but it sure is how it's fun. Also in the lobby are two other main game modes, that being deathmatch and custom games. Match is basically a practice tool, if you die you respawn in 1.5 seconds, and you can buy any gun you like at all times. There's no teams and the first person of 40 kills wins. People will use this to practice their gun skill, relax, or simply work on their mechanics like AMN movement. Custom games are another tool that you can use to practice on your own empty maps, but more often than not it's used to play with and against friends or to play 5B5 games team vs team. Lastly to the left of the start button there will always be a smaller gray button that allows you to enter the range, where you have a shooting range and two practice tools both for planting and diffusing the spike. More about that later. So now that we've established the lobby, let's talk about the normal game mode and its objective. So in Valorant Ranked and Unrated, the goal is pretty simple and depends on your side. Generally a round can be won in one of two ways and you need 13 rounds total in order to win a game. Firstly, you can simply eliminate all 5 of your opponents as the game is played 5 vs 5. If your team is the last one standing without the other team having completed the objective beforehand, your team wins the round. If you're on the attacker team, your goal is to bring the spike, which can be picked up in spawn by a player at the start of the round to one of the bomb sites. Plant the spike there and let it explode. The defenders are trying to do the exact opposite, which is prevent the attackers from planting the spike and otherwise diffuse it before it explodes. If they manage to force the attackers to run out of time, which by the way is a minute 40, the defenders also win. So yeah, pretty simple stuff. Two teams, one is trying to get onto a bomb site and plant the bomb and the others are trying to prevent that. In order to balance the game, the attackers are spawned further away from the bomb sites, meaning that the defenders have the advantage of being able to hold their ground and set up for an inevitable attack. While attackers have the advantage of being able to bring bigger numbers to a site, there's multiple bomb sites, which all should be held by the defensive site and that while the attackers know where they want to go and the defenders don't. Alright, so before you actually start playing games, there's a few more things we should discuss. That being the fundamentals, some rules of the game, how the economy works, how the different agents and roles they fill and lastly the different maps. But before we do that, let's quickly go over our question of the day. Today's question being, when did you start playing Valorant? Personally for me, I started playing all the way back on the first day of beta and I've been playing ever since. So what about you guys? When did you start? Make sure to comment when you started down below in the comment section. In order to defend, or get onto these sites, four things are very important. Aiming, crosshair placement, movement, and abilities. The first three we'll talk about now. Aiming is a tactical shooter which makes not only tactics important, but also mostly shooting. In order to shoot straight and have success, these three concepts of aiming, crosshair placement and movement are important. Aim is what everyone instantly thinks about right away when they think about shooters and generally it's just about being able to place your crosshair on targets. In Valorant, that being enemies and enemy abilities. Aim is important because if your aim isn't very good, it's easy to lose duels against players that you may have even outplayed tactically. Aim can be practiced in a multitude of ways. The most effective one being using aim trainers like Aim Lab. But you can also use practice tools like the range or death match. We won't talk about training your aim too much in this video as we only have so much time. But if you want to improve that specifically, we have plenty of guides on our channel. So simply subscribe to keep up to date and check out the rest of our channel for our aim guides. Crosshair placement is another super important concept, arguably even more important than aiming, as it helps lessen the need for raw aim in a major way. Arguing over which is pretty pointless, but the gist of it is you want both to be as best as possible. With great aim and bad crosshair placement, you'll get out aim still by people with great crosshair placement and average aim. And the other way around as well. A healthy mix of both is key. So what is it exactly? Well crosshair placement is placing your crosshair tactically in order to minimize the amount of aiming you'll actually have to do. Basically it's putting your crosshair wherever you expect your opponents to be so that if they're indeed there, you can simply click and you'll barely have to do any aiming at all. Crosshair placement is closely linked to map knowledge so it isn't always easy for new players. It's easily practiced in death match and customs. Just keep your crosshair at head level and try to track walls and corners as best as you can. If you actively put effort into the skill, it really will come with time as soon as you get more use to where players can be. Aim at head level at all times and perhaps even watch pros or better players. Last of the three is movement. And that's got everything to do with the fact that for the most part you really can't run and shoot. Certainly, there are a few guns that make that statement a bit debatable. But the best weapons are to be used shooting stationary, meaning that being able to control your movement and quickly stop when you want to shoot is most needed. Quickly stopping in order to shoot is a movement technique called counterstrafing. It gets its name from the players countering their strafe by strafing shortly in the opposite direction. If you're going forward, you can counterstraf by quickly tapping S. If you're going left, you can do the same with D and so on. This is a technique that's best to practice by buying a vandal in the practice range and moving in between your shots versus bots. It's hard at first but becomes second nature quite quickly as long as you put in some practice. If you want more in-depth tips with improving any of your fundamentals or exploring what each agent has to offer at the highest levels, make sure to come visit us at ProGuides.com where our top ranked players are more than happy to bring you up to speed with anything valorant. Just click the link in the description if you're interested and let's keep going. So let's go over a couple more important things about the game firstly. There's the spike. We already talked about it a bit, but it's time to go a bit more in depth. Rounds are a minute and forty seconds long, and before the round ends, the attacker team will have to plant the spike in order to have a chance of winning the round. Bikes can only be planted on bomb sites. Then there's the designated planting area that'll light up if you're carrying the spike, like shown here. Planting the spike takes exactly four seconds, meaning you may need to start planting at least four seconds before time runs out or the defenders win. Then a forty-five second timer starts before the bomb explodes. The only way defenders can now prevent the attackers from winning is by diffusing the spike before it explodes. Diffusing it takes seven seconds, but it does have a checkpoint at the halfway mark, meaning that if a player defuses for at least three point five seconds but does not defuse the spike completely, it'll now only take an additional three point five seconds to fully diffuse. The latest possible time you can defuse the spike is also indicated. You can see this by the white circle indicator. This means there's only seven seconds left to diffuse, so if you're already diffusing and you see the indicator, you have enough time. Another major part about Valorant is the economy. In Valorant's main game mode, you have to buy Guns yourself, meaning that you need to make wise economic decisions in order to be able to afford the best gear. The first round of each half, so the first round on either side, is always a pistol round, where everyone will be forced to use a pistol. Players only get 800 credits, and this allows them to buy either an upgraded pistol, utility, shields, or a combination of both. A better gun is obviously better in order to have a better chance of winning raw aim tools, while utility can allow you to take better fights and shields are essentially extra health. There's two types, light shields and heavy shields. Light shields being an extra twenty-five health and heavy being an extra fifty. One of the two most important things to know for economy are that you one generally always want to buy together with your team in order to have the best chance of winning the round. And two, you want to maximize your rounds with strong gear by sometimes choosing to spend less on one round, in order to be able to afford more on the next. This tactic is called E-going, and it's basically saving credits in a certain round to be able to have a good buy in the following round. You can do this by looking at the buy menu and paying attention to the men next round text. Here, it will showcase the minimum credits you'll have in the following rounds regardless of what happens. Even that you need to have forty-five hundred credits to buy fully with most agents. But of course, that also depends on how expensive your abilities are, and whether or not you used abilities in the previous round. You'll get more familiar with the economy over time. But for now, aiming for forty-five hundred credits minimum the next round, if your team can't fully buy in the current one, is always a pretty good idea. So what do we mean with a good buy? Well we mean that you're able to purchase the best guns and most or even all of your abilities together with a heavy shield. The best three guns in the game are the operator and amazing one shot kill sniper rifle, the Vandal, a great rifle, especially suited for mids a long range, and the fans of the best rifle in the game anywhere but long range. Generally on defense you want to have one operator with four rifles, and on attack you want to do the same or instead five rifles depending on your preferences. For the rifles you want to focus on shooting your short accurate bursts of two to four bows in order to be the most accurate, and at a close range you can also spray if it's what you prefer. While using the operator you of course want to focus on being clean and slow. Missing shots with the bolt action sniper is a lot more punishing as it's going to be a while before you get your next shot in, so taking a little extra time to make sure you really hit is definitely something to be frowned upon. Of course these tips were very general, so if you want to know more about the rifles we have guides for all three of these guns, so you can definitely learn more by looking at the rest of our channel. So let's get started about agents and their abilities. Each agent has three basic abilities and an ultimate. One is a signature ability meaning that the agent gets at least one of them for free, and the other two can be bought in the shop. The ultimate cannot be bought but rather requires anywhere from 6 to 8 ultimate points. Ultimate points can be rewarded in a multitude of ways. The simplest way is by getting a kill or dying. Dying or getting a kill rewards the player with one ultimate point, so if a player gets three kills in a round and then dies, they in total get four ultimate points. Another way an ultimate point can be received is by planting or diffusing a spike, and lastly by picking up ultimate orbs which are spawned on fixed spots on the map each round. On every map but one there's two spots where the ultimate orbs are spawned, but the fracture which we'll talk about later is an exception with four ultimate orbs ready to be collected each round. Although no, these ultimate orbs disappear after around as one or the spike is planted. Additionally it is important to realize that if you have enough ultimate points in order to use your ultimate, you stop saving up ultimate points even if you collect orbs. Kill people or plant the spike. At that point, ultimate points wise it's pretty pointless. So saving your ultimate for the best possible scenario isn't always great as it can stop you from using your ultimate multiple times in a half. Okay, so each Asian has different abilities and different roles, so let's go over all the agents' role by role starting with the duelists. The duelist role is one that's most popular, people enjoy playing duelists. As the name implies, they're best suited for finding duels and taking 1v1s. They for the most part have pretty self-sufficient kits and self-scibilities that allow them to thrive in 1v1s and win duels more easily. In a team, duels are expected to find openings for the team by getting picks and go looking for 1v1s. On side takes and retakes, they're generally expected to go in first. But if you have multiple duels or perhaps don't have the best duels to entry, that might not always be the most effective way to play. The duelist role feels the most agents. Firstly, there's Jet. Jet is a staple of the meta as she is currently the best agent to wield the operator because of her signature dash ability that allows her to quickly dash forward, backwards, and sideways. On top of that, she also has an ability that effectively allows her to dash upwards. She has a short duration smoke that she can throw on the fly and her ultimate is 100% accurate weapon even while moving or jumping. On top of that, Jet is currently the only agent with the pass of allowing her to hover in the air by holding down her jump key. Phoenix is another duelist that has a signature Molly that can either heal him or hurt his enemies and allies. He also has a small wall that he can curve any way he likes and has two flashes. His ultimate is quite cheap at 6 points and allows him to walk out of his body and be able to run anywhere he likes for 10 seconds after he teleports back. If he dies while using his ultimate, he also teleports back and stays alive, although he does lose his shields. His ultimate is thus great for entering bombsites first as dying isn't a big deal. Neon is the newest agent in the game, at least currently, and she has her signature E which allows her to sprint and slide once every two kills. She also has a bouncing grenade that stuns twice and essentially two Phoenix walls combined making it kind of like a new lane entrance, another powerful entry tool. Her ultimate is a laser beam that does a whole load of damage at close range and is used in combination with her sprint. Raises another duelist that has a signature grenade which does a lot of damage. She has two blast packs that allow her to blow up sage walls due damage to opponents or send herself flying. And she also has a robot that can clear buildings for her as it detects and blows up enemies unless they shoot it. Her ultimate is a bazooka which can one shot kill and has great synergy with her blast packs. Raina is another duelist that has an interesting kit that allows her to heal or go shortly invulnerable after kills. Additionally she has a flash which needs to be shot in order to be effectively dealt with. Her ultimate buffs her two signature abilities, allowing her to heal automatically and making her dismiss not only invulnerable but also invisible. On top of that she has unlimited orbs and shoots faster. Lastly we have Yorou. He has a signature teleport ability which he can use to teleport or fake teleport. He has a clone that runs forwards and flashes opponents when shot and on top of that he has flashbangs. His ultimate allows him to go invisible and invincible and he can exit anywhere he likes plus he can use utility while in it. If duelist is something for you we highly recommend that you start out with either raise or reign as both have very easy to understand kits and definitely aren't bad. But if you want to play the best of the bunch you could always decide to play Jett although playing her properly might prove to be a bit more difficult. The next role we should mention is that of the initiators. Initiators are essentially the role that has the best directly supportive kits and they generally have pretty good synergy with the duelist in order to get picks. Basically they're what allows other teammates to thrive but a lot of them have utility that can allow them to play off themselves. The first agent under this category is Sousa. Sousa has been a staple of the initiator role ever since the beta began for the game. There hasn't been a single patch with Sousa but hasn't been meta and he's always been consistently good. His signature ability is a recharging recon arrow that scans through surroundings whenever it lands and highlights enemies at spots. He also has shockdarts which are used the same way as the recon dart except they deal damage whenever it lands. Lastly he has an owl drum which can also tag enemies to highlight them and is used as a supportive entry tool. His ultimate allows him to send three massive shots through walls or any structure which is great for after plants or to kill players that are highlighted or stuck in a corner. Skies another initiator that has a very supportive side but she also can be self-sufficient. The reason for that are her signature flashes. She gets a Q as to when she flashes an opponent in order for it to be an information gain but they're also potent kill flashes which are best used for teammates but she can also use them for herself. On top of that she has a tiger, a bit like Sousa's drum but on the ground instead and she has a heal for anyone but herself. Her ultimate scouts out the three nearest enemies and sends a secret towards them. Reach is similar to Skye. His signature is a recharging stun but he also has flashes and he also has a damage dealing ability that clears corners. His flashes are best used for teammates but they can be used for himself. His ultimate stuns and sends people flying in a large radius making it a great entry tool. KO is the last initiator and he is a signature knife that he can throw to disable abilities and to allow anyone from using new ones if they're in range. On top of that he also has flashes and a Molly. His ultimate disables people around him in a fairly large range and allows him to get downed instead of dying instantly whenever he dies. On top of that he also fires a bit faster, another useful ultimate to entry onto sites. For initiators we highly recommend playing Sousa. He has always been good in the meta and he is a great agent to learn what initiators are all about. He is a must pick on many maps and his only weak maps are split and fracture. Overall he's a great pick. Next on the list are the controllers. These are smoke wielding agents that are able to change the way people play around sites by smoking off many angles or blocking sight lines. The first agent in this list is Astra. She has four stars as she can place anywhere on the map and then she can transform these stars into smokes, stuns or sucks depending on what she sees fit. And don't worry if you misplaced, you can always take these stars back and replace them later. Her ultimate effectively splits the map into as it's a huge wall that you cannot see, shoot or hear through. The next one is Viper. She has a signature wall that she can essentially split a site into two. On top of that she also has a smoke and two mollies. These can also be used in synergy in order to stall diffuses by playing back with lineups for the plant spot, although this is somewhat advanced. Her ultimate is very strong as it basically allows her to fill an entire bombsite with toxic smoke, which makes people lose vision and health if they enter. Players won't die but they will go all the way down to 1 HP and it's easier for you to spot opponents in your ultimate than it is for them to spot you. Then we have Brimstone. He can use his three smokes all at once to really set up a site take. These smokes last the longest in the game and they have the advantage of not being hollow. He also has a Mali and quite a potent one at that. Plus he has two Stim Beacons which allows any teammates standing near them to shoot faster and even move faster now. This ability used to be Mediocre at best, but ever since the speed boost got added to it it has become one of the best abilities in the game. His ultimate does a lot of damage in a small zone so it allows him to either play after plant or kill people stuck in a corner. Lastly we have Omen. Omen is able to smoke a lot further than Brimstone can, but he is slow to place multiple smokes as he needs to be doing them one by one. And he also only has two at a time. On the plus side his smokes do recharge. He also has a flash and he has two short range teleports. His ultimate however is a teleport where he can go anywhere on the map he wants to or he can cancel it if he regrets his choice. He can't even use his ultimate to pick up the spike and plant somewhere else entirely. For control we recommend playing Brimstone. He's probably the easiest smoker to play and he adds so much value to the team with his Stim Packs. Vipar is very very important on some maps as well. But she's a lot harder to play and thus we don't really recommend her to newer players. For the final role we have the Sentinels, which are experts at holding areas of the map. They have good stalling utility and they make pushing sites very difficult. The first sentinel will talk about his Sage. Although generally she isn't considered to be a really good one, Sage is a good agent. She has a good kit and really helps her team. But the sentinel role for her isn't a perfect fit. Although she doesn't really fit anywhere just consider her to be kind of roleless. Her signature ability is a recharging heal that can heal up to 60 health and she also has a wall that allows her to block an entrance although it can be broken quite rapidly. And she also has a slow orb which makes entering a bombsite quite annoying as you'll be walking very very slowly. As you can tell these two abilities are what make her a sentinel but they're not really as strong as the other sentinel utility in the game. And lastly her ultimate is a revive which she can use to resurrect a fallen ally. One of the best ultimates in the game hands down. The first real sentinel is Cypher. She has a signature camera which she can use to hold angles for information without the risk of dying. He also has two trips which she can use to slow down and kill anyone trying to enter a bombsite or angle. Lastly he has cages which are a bit like smokes except he needs to be close to the angle he wants to place them. These are great to get out of angles using them as smokes but they can also be comboed up with his trip wires in order to kill people safely through a cage while they light up due to his trip. His ultimate needs the body of a recently fallen foe but if he finds one he can then use it to reveal the other enemies remaining on the map. A pretty good ultimating case you need to really figure out where your opponents are. Then we have Killjoy. Her signature ability is a turret which any opponent in may spot it does a small amounts of damage to. More importantly though it slows and tags them substantially which makes it a major annoyance. She also has Molotovs that can be pre-placed and activated at any time which synergizes greatly with her alarm bot that attacks and temporarily doubles the damage on enemies at spots. Generally you put your alarm bot close to your mollies and if someone walks through them you can kill them quickly or at least do massive damage. Entering a site that Killjoy is holding should usually be pretty painful already but then she also has a really strong ultimate, her lockdown. Killjoy's ultimate when placed forces enemies to leave the area within 13 seconds or else they get detained for 8 meaning that they're not able to use their weapons, they walk slowly and thus they are easy prey. A great ultimate either for taking or sight retakes. Lastly we have Chamber. Chamber is an interesting sentinel but a strong one nonetheless. His signature ability allows him to teleport from one place to another which either helps him rotate easier, go for aggressive peaks or do weird teleport plays to catch opponents off guard. He also has trips that scans like Killjoy's alarm bot but instead slows opponents and alerts Chamber to when they go off. His other ability is essentially a better version of the sheriff except it can only have up to 8 bullets and his ultimate is a better version of the operator that also has these slow feels whenever he kills a player. For sentinel's we recommend playing Killjoy. He is a great agent to get started with and she has a great kit that won't hold you back. Your agent comp and valorant definitely doesn't matter too much when you're playing not in the highest of ranks but as a general tip try to have one of each role at least as that's what's probably the easiest way to play the game. Alright with agents out of the way it's time to quickly go over the other maps. Currently there are 7 and all of them have something that's unique to them. Split initially was unique for the fact that it had ropes that you could go up and down but nowadays icebox and fracture have them too. So it's more unique for the fact that everything is so close range. Split is a map where mid control is super important and having a lot of your team's resources there is the name of the game. Next up is bind. Bind is unique for the teleporters it has from A-Short to B-Mid and B-Long to A-Showers which allows attackers to fake and rotate quickly through them. Everything here is also very close range. It usually ends up being fairly defender sided so if you have a bad attacker half stay in the game as your opponents might run into the same problems. Haven is another map that is quite unique. At this time for the fact that it doesn't have one not two but three bomb sites. All of which play very differently. Haven is definitely the map that is the most unique for the fact that it has three bomb sites but honestly a lot of the time B is ignored so it doesn't really matter anyway. A set is a community favorite map that is unique for its closing doors both on B-Market and A-Tree. It has a very important mid section which really offers a lot of control, making it an important hold for both attackers and defenders. Icebox is a map that is unique for its zip lines but it also plays very interestingly. The Cypher on this map is pretty much a must pick both on A and B sites and it's pretty difficult to play at a very high level. Breeze is unique for the trap door it has in the tube but perhaps more importantly because it's so open. It being extremely open again means that Vipers is more important although without it you can work through mid, tube and elbow and split all around the map to make site takes easier. Lastly we have Fracture, another very unique map but at this time because the attackers can come from both sites and the defenders spawn in the middle. At first it might feel really weird to play but it actually kind of works and makes it quite a fun map to play. Well guys that's going to wrap it up, good to see you stuck along all the way to the end and hopefully we answered all of your questions. If you have any left make sure to comment them down below and we'll go over them there or in future videos. Thanks for watching and make sure to subscribe and we'll see you in the next one.\"}, {'prompt': '', 'completion': \" Today I'm gonna give you 50 fallerant tips and tricks. In this video we're gonna focus on agent abilities, so I won't give specific tips and tricks on maps or guns. Before we start the video I want to thank everyone we recently got more subscribers than human catchery and now our next goal is the world of cats. With your help we can do it. Now let's hop into the first trick. If you want to flash with Phoenix try not to stand against the wall but try to stand diagonal to the wall. This way you have a little bit more time to pre-aim the enemies and the enemies have a little bit less time to react. If you place your wall with sage don't throw an orb immediately after you place the wall. I see a lot of people doing this in lower elo but it's useless. Unless you're gonna peek after you throw your orbs, like here in mid split. The stem beacon of brimstone gives you a rapid fire. This does not work with pistol so stop using it in pistol rounds. Unless someone got a frenzy then it will affect the fire rate. If you play on the defending side with Fiper try to save your wall for the retake. Your wall is really helpful if you want to retake a side like you see in the clip in the background. Also you decide when you put your wall down so when you have coffe put it down early so you can kill the enemy easy peasy. If you time it correctly you can use your shrouded step over breaches ult made. If you're playing Omen and you got a sage on your team on a scent you can use this combo to get to a side. I'm not sure who came up with this trick but definitely not me. I got it from flexing jar so credits to him. If you want to flash the teleporter with you Roo and want to push behind it don't do it in the middle of the teleporter. It will most likely flash yourself. Instead of using it in the middle use it a little bit to the right of the teleporter. It will bounce against the door, go back and will flash behind you. If enemies are looking at you they will get flashed and you can kill them easy peasy. If you want to use your ult after a double jump with race don't double jump and then use your ult. As you see in the background it will take a while before you can fire your ult. Instead of using your ult at the end use your ult in between the double jumps then you can fire your ult immediately. A nice combo with breaches is using your E over here and then using your C immediately after. A lot of people are tend to jump over to that side but when they are stunned your C will kill them easy peasy. If killjoy you can throw your nouns from in the middle of container. If you activate it it will hit almost all the plant spots on B side. You can make a one way with killjoy and it's H well. The good thing is that you can almost make it everywhere. The bad thing is that it cost a lot of abilities and you can only shoot on the enemies feet. But it can be useful somewhere so try it out. Use your ult and updraft combo with jet to get free kills from unexpected angles. You can see a few examples of this in the background. I feel a bit silly to explain this but I still get a lot of questions how you can do it. You can press R to change your form in your smoke ability with Omen. Reina her flash got a maximum range. So for example if you want to flash C long don't flash it over here because it does not reach the back of C long. The same goes for cipher and killjoy and other H twitch setups by the way. Be unpredictable so use different camera spots, strip wires, killjoy turrets, F3 round. You can hide your nano swarm behind this spot. The enemy will not see it. You can also hide your alarm bot and your nano swarm in this spot over here. Just keep in mind that they both make a lot of noise so the enemies might find it anyway. In the background you see me flying and spraying. They also call this an attack helicopter. If you like this attack helicopter please give this video a thumbs up. It really helps growing my channel. Thank you. When you use your flashbang with sky you can hold your ability button to aim where your bird flies. You don't have to do it like you see in this clip. Your bird fly automatically around corners so you can push behind it. The first option is good to use if you want to fly your bird over buildings like you see in the clip in the background. If you want to retake A on haven with killjoy, place your ult over here. If you look on the minimap you see only one place enemy players can hide. Then stand over here, match the top left corner of your ability with the top left corner of the window and throw your Molotov. This nano swarm will nicely land in the corner. Here an essential lineup for a short with Phoenix aim at the top of the building and do a small running throw. This is a very very nice Molotov. When playing with Yuru, throw your flashbang so the enemies has a little time as possible to react. So in this case don't throw it against the wall on site but throw it against the window or even better use the ground. You have to be careful with this one though because you might flash yourself. Instead of throwing your nano swarms on the boom every round try to learn linux with killjoy. Like this one. Stand in this corner aim a little bit left of the roof and easy piece you got the easy lineup. Throw this nano swarm before the enemies are planting. If you're playing jet always keep moving if you use your ult. I see a lot of people standing still, then shoot and then walk away. But instead of doing that just keep walking and keep shooting. It's a little harder to do but it will help you get easy kills. Which raise on a scent this is an easy running and jumping throw that got me a lot of kills. If you are playing with a sage on your team stand over here and split. Let their use your wall and then use your double jump with ult combo to look to a ramp. This will cost a lot of abilities but it might work you never know. If you want to defend the boom with fiper it's highly recommended to use your smoke in combination with your poison. You can do this by throwing your cue on the spike and using your sea ability with a lineup. Here two easy line ups on default plant on split. For both line ups standing in this corner for the lineup behind the billboard aim at the top right of the light of that building and for the other line up aim at the bottom left of the light of the building. These line ups will nicely land on default plant easy piece. Here an easy lineup with race that I use all the time just stand over here aim a little bit under the middle of the top box and do a jumping throw. If you want to get on the tube fast you can use this double jump. With the correct timing you can stay alive if you use your Phoenix ult before the race ult hits you. With Omen you can use your shrouded step before you enter the teleporter to fake a teleporter. You can press your right mouse button to place two fake outs on the ground. After that you can activate them for anywhere on the map. If you rule ults inside Fyper's ult Fyper can see him. Instead of using the same sofa lineup back to back try to learn line ups where the arrows will land on the same time. Most of the time the enemies will expect the second arrow so with this double line ups the enemies won't expect it and will die instantly if both arrows hit them on the same time. For a very easy cipher one way stand against this corner aim over there and throw your smoke. You can use this one way in combination with your camera for easy kills. If you play with an operator and you make a kill with Reyna or Jett always use your eability to get to safety. Reyna and Jett are the only two agents that can get to safety after they make a kill. That's why they are in my opinion the best agents to play with an operator. If you want to go for an aggressive peek with Jett on icebox stand against the barrier, spam your dash ability and make a kill easy peasy. This one is a little risky but I believe you can do it. Don't use the same wall at the same place, F-L-R down with Sage. Try to wait a little bit or even better try to go on a different side each round. For my own experience if people are playing Sage on A F-R down I always go to B or C. I avoid Sage because Sage is a pain to push you know. Be unpredictable. Be unpredictable. Be unpredictable. Guys I'm really trying my best at this English thing but I'm not good so be sorry. If you want to smoke something try to always smoke on the opposite side of the wall. In this case you have to smoke on that side. This will give you a lot of advantage. In the clip in the background you see someone who didn't do it because the enemy omen smoked more the side than CT. I could push on the right side of the smoke without people from Elbow seeing me. If you want to do the Eference Jones trick shoot your arrow with full charge and two bounces on the ground then shoot one arrow with full charge and two bounces in the air. Good luck with this one. Try to use your jet smoke as a one way. The good thing about this is that you can use it almost everywhere. You will have to practice how high your smoke has to be. If you want to use your ult with Brimstone try to use it and peak immediately after it. This way you can get a lot of free kills. If the Tasmanian Tiger is running towards you it may be better to don't shoot it but just walk away. This way you give the enemy sky less information. Because the fishing of the Tasmanian Tiger is not that high you can just walk away without the enemy seeing you. And sorry for last video I called it a Tiger but the Tasmanian Tiger is something different. Sorry for that. If you want to push with Breach try sometimes to flash two times this might fake the enemy. Well this is the end of the video. If I didn't mention something let me know in the comments and I might make a part two. If you liked this video please give it a like it really helps. Subscribe and I'll see you in the next one.\"}, {'prompt': '', 'completion': \" You ever learned something that you're just like, man, I really wish I knew that when I started playing. Well, that's literally what this video is about. Those bits of information that are literally making the world of difference between you getting better at the game, and you just walking around like a bot. My name is the King Live, and in the beta I was placed in Iron 2. But by fighting through blood, sweat, and tears, I was able to make my way all the way up to Immortal, and I'm going to give you guys all the things that I think are the most important things for Valorant players to know in the game. And some of these things are things that players just aren't going to tell you. I know I don't mean their secret tips that nobody's heard of, but what I mean is I've been making Valorant Guide content for pretty much the last year, and guides pretty much just consistently tell you the same things. So let me try to give you things that you maybe don't hear all that often. The first thing being that aim isn't as important as you think. Don't get me wrong, having good aim can be a great asset. But people treat the game especially when starting out, as if aim is the only important factor. When you're learning the game, you should focus on improving your raw aim, of course. This means doing aim trainers and death match and actively trying to take duels in your matches. But there will be a point where your aim will be good enough, and that point will come sooner than you think. People miss shots. Rather than telling yourself your aim could have been better, try to ask yourself how could you have made the shots easier to hit? This sort of segues perfectly into the next tip, which is bad teammates can still be perfectly set up. Listen guys, your teammates might be terrible, but I've seen this in practice so many times from our Smurf commentaries on our website, where we have a radiant level player matched up with bad teammates, and they were able to make these bad teammates look like exceptional players. And they do this by playing off of them and turning their mistakes into an advantage. Basically the logic here is, if your teammate is going to do something stupid, you yourself can try to make that stupid play less stupid. I play a lot of Omen for example, so a way that I'll do that is if my teammate is going to wide swing somebody for no reason, I'll be there to blind that target when they actually take the fight. Another way is if your teammate is just sitting alone in a one and done, try to bait for them, because if you don't they're just going to get themselves killed. Furthermore what this means is that if you communicate with your teammates clearly, and correctly, you can generally, generally count on them to trade you. Trust me, I've practiced this with my friends who are literally brand new to the game, and if you tell them when you're going to swing and say swing with me, and then count it down, regardless of how good or bad they are as a player, they will generally be able to get a trade. So, I'm going to go onto the third tip though, and that is that teamplay is what separates radiance from immortals, and obviously the comparison radiance to immortals isn't relevant to a lot of people watching this video, and that's not to throw any shade, everybody starts somewhere, but the thing you need to realize is that you can start working on your teamplay right now, whatever rank you are. Specifically what I mean is that radiant players are constantly aware of what their teammates are doing and how to play off of them. A great way to play off of your teammates as well is by comboing utility, for example, using an omen blind at the same time your sova uses his recon, or using a raise ultimate at the same time your sky-olds. There are a lot of different ways that you can combo utility, but these are things that you'll see pros do all of the time, because one ability alone is generally a lot easier to handle than two to three abilities being comboed together. If there's anything I've learned from a mortal level lobbies and analyzing pro plays, it's that immortal players are still too much of solo players. Immortal players are really good at playing solo, but they don't really understand teamplay all that much and it holds them back. And that means it's probably holding you back in your ranks too. The next tip is actually a little bit relative, but at least in my experience and what I've heard from pros, tends included, playing less is generally the secret to ranking up more. Now obviously there's a potential to rank up more by playing more, and the best way to get better at the game is by playing the game. But in my experience, the best way to rank up is to play just a few games a day and actually focus during them. Don't tell us, don't rage when you miss shots and don't get upset with your teammates. Just play a few games and genuinely enjoy them. So play better, you'll notice you win more and when you lose, you won't go on a loss streak because you'll quit playing. Obviously the counterpart to this is queuing a lot, and hey, if you win every game doing this, yeah, obviously it will be faster. But that's not normally how it's going to go, and that's why if you're looking to climb I suggest to play less. Tip number five has to deal with team comps, and that tip is it's absolutely necessary to have a controller on your team. I don't care if it's Viper, Omen, Brimstone, or Astra, you need to have a controller on your team, otherwise you're going to have a very rough time in the game. Personally for me, the game's not even fun without a controller, there are just too many angles and it's incredibly obnoxious to deal with. This isn't just my take though, I've heard this from pro players like Fanatic Boaster as well. You can get away without a Sentinel, you can get away without an initiator, but if your team doesn't have a controller, it's going to be a rough time and you should save yourself the trouble in either dodge or lock a controller. And that's actually what brings us to our sixth tip, which is everything else doesn't matter. If you've got a controller, don't lock a Sentinel if you don't know how to play a Sentinel. Don't lock an initiator if you don't know how to play initiator. Listen, I'd rather have you lock an agent that you know how to play well rather than locking an agent that you've never played before because it's good on a map. The only exception to this rule I might say is that Viper is pretty necessary on Breeze and Sage is pretty necessary on Icebox. You can obviously still win without them, but they are both very, very strong on those respective maps, and I do believe without them it does make the game quite a bit more difficult. But hey, if you don't know how to use those agents on those maps, not going to matter all that much. Remember, it's the utility that makes agents different and if you don't know how to use their utility, they're useless. So don't pick an agent that you don't know how to play for the purpose of filling, unless it's controller. This next one is a bit more difficult to do, but what I've started to realize most recently is that when you're dealing with the team that likes to just full rush everything, the best way to deal with them is to set up crossfires and shoot them down when they're coming in. You will not, and I repeat, will not be able to deal with a 5-man rush solo when they are using utility and barreling down on site. You need your teammates to help you, and you need to position in a way where you and your teammates can play off of each other. Obviously throwing down a Molly to block the entrance gives your team more time to rotate, and this can be super helpful, but if you're setting up on a site in a way where you're going to be taking a 1v1 duel, you really want to avoid doing this. The way most site defenses work is you'll have one player in a position where they'll take first contact, and then you'll have another player who will peek off of their contact. But if instead you have one player who takes contact solo, and then they die, and then another player who takes contact solo, and then they die, like what have you accomplished? Set up a crossfire instead with your teammates on site, and stop setting up solo. Play off of your teammates, and you'll get more kills and win more games. Moving on to tip number 8, the topic of crosshair placement is kind of meamed up, but the reason it's meamed up is because crosshair placement is basically the whole game. At the end of the day, if your crosshair placement was perfect like many players seem to believe there's is, you'd win every single 1v1 duel because all you would have to do is click. This is why it's so important to learn when you're starting out, but many lower rank players kind of just shrug it off and go, yeah, yeah. Like yeah, the reason we say it a lot is because it's a very large part of the game. That's why a lot of the job of the teacher is to find new interesting ways to teach a subject players maybe have already heard about, because clearly the ways we're teaching it before didn't stick, but maybe this one will. If you're below the rank of a mortal, your crosshair placement probably sucks. Try to work on it a little bit. The ninth tip though is that baiting your teammates is really easy to do, and I don't mean a good type of baiting, I mean the bad type of baiting. Sometimes your headspace is just not in the place it should be, and you don't even realize you're baiting your teammates incredibly hard. Maybe you're sitting there inside of a smoke doing nothing, or maybe you're playing in a position far away when you could be pushing up to help them. Bating your teammates is really easy to do accidentally, and it takes active attention not to do. Bating isn't something that you just flip a switch and suddenly you're not doing it. Even the best players have times where their rounds play out and they're like, oh shoot, I accidentally baited the heck out of that guy. It happens, but by acknowledging that it happens, we can try to make it happen less. Always keep an eye on your map, and try to think about how you can be helping your teammates during the round, and it will reduce the amount that you accidentally bait them. Speaking of looking at the map though, let's talk about the opposite thing that has gone on and has all killed far too much, and that is looking at the map at the worst time and getting killed because of this. One of the ways I've learned to avoid this is if you're holding an angle rather than looking at the map, try asking your teammates what they're seeing. Hopefully if you're holding an angle you can rely on callouts for your teammates just a little bit more and that way you won't have to glance at the map all the time. Because theoretically they all have the same information on their map that you do, right? So hopefully if you ask people what they're seeing, they can say the same exact thing that you will see. This obviously isn't going to always work because sometimes people just won't talk, but in that case it might be best just to give up the angle and look at the map and then repeat afterwards to save yourself the risk. This next tip is something that's a bit more obvious, but still so many players have a bad habit of this and that is pushing smokes that they really shouldn't be pushing. We've all been there where we're pushing a smoke thinking I really shouldn't be pushing this. Like I said, so many players have this bad habit of needing to push every single smoke that they see and just waiting a little bit for the smoke to dissipate can oftentimes be so much better. You don't need to push every single smoke that you see, it's okay to let a smoke exist and hold it. And what you'll find is, like I said, many players have this bad habit, so if you hold a smoke, oftentimes players will push them and you'll pick up a free kill because of this. Like I said though, there are sometimes when pushing a smoke is okay, but start thinking about the situations where you don't have to a little bit more and you'll probably save yourself a number of times. Tip number 12 takes us to probably one of the biggest things I wish I knew, which is communication is one of the harder skills to improve in Valorant. I think this one literally just revolves around getting people out of their comfort zone, so many gamers are incredibly introverted and trying to get people to communicate effectively in game can be really hard. That being said, that's why it's so valuable if you can get people who actually know how to communicate well on a team. I wish when I started out in Valorant, I practiced making callouts just a little bit more and actively communicated what my intentions were within the round because it would have helped me improve a lot faster. This is something I still struggle with today and it's because communication is very hard and for many players it's the thing holding them back. Tip number 13 is another problem that most players have though, which is they probably use counterstrafing wrong. Lots of people know what counterstrafing is, but they don't actively use it within their matches. Instead what they do is they go, yeah, yeah counterstrafing. And then every time they take an engagement, they will full crouch in the open and get them self-killed. Listen, if you're going to be taking a prolonged engagement in the open or you're fighting multiple enemies at the same time, you need to be counterstrafing between your shots. Otherwise you're going to get traded out or worse, killed before you can even get one. Counterstrafing doesn't actually make you accurate, faster, and Valorant, so the point of counterstrafing isn't to hit your shots faster, the point of it is to make yourself more difficult to hit. Tip number 14 takes us into something that many players, especially in low elo struggle with though, and that is relying too much on gimmicks. What is a gimmick though? Well, those are things like Wombo, combo, killjoy, setup, cypher setup, sage wall, boost, aggressive, omen plays, double-shock dart line-ups, stuff like that. And listen, gimmicks can be really cool, but what you need to understand though is that they're gimmicks for a reason and you're probably going to peek with them eventually. Whether that peek is goal 3 or that peek is immortal, eventually you're going to run into players that they don't work against and you're going to have to adapt. This doesn't mean remove those gimmicks from your playbook though, this just means to understand when they will work and when they won't work, and use them sparingly. Lots of players don't have this skill, but when you develop this skill, that's when you'll run into some of the best and most exciting players to watch. That sort of ties into our next tip though, which is to pay attention to pro play. When you watch pro play, it will be a lot more simple to understand what standard play looks like and how you can sort of copy what they do. Now obviously pro play and matchmaking are super different, but you'll start to pick up on basic concepts of things that are good. You'll start to understand how pros play clutch situations, how they use their utility to grab territory, how they play around their teammates really well, people roast the casters and valour to lot, but some of them actually do a really excellent job of explaining what players are doing and why they're doing it. When casting, generally there's going to be a play by playcaster and then a colorcaster. The colorcaster's job is to generally provide analysis during the game, to give viewers a detailed understanding of why pros might do what they do, and then the play by play castors' job is to generally cover the more height moments and break down the more intense visuals on the screen for the viewer. If you're looking to improve, try to listen to what the colorcaster is saying during the slower parts of the round to have a good understanding of what is going on in the game. Many of these guys do a really good job of this. Moving on to number 16 though, and we say this a lot on the channel, if you haven't been recording your games yet you really should. One of the easiest ways to pick out your mistakes and valourant is to look back through them when you're not playing and think about what you could have done better. Luckily we recently launched our own community discord where you can submit your own vods for us to review, so if you're looking to get your games looked at by us and potentially featured in a video, be sure to check that out in the description below. Moving on to tip number 17 though, and that's going to be to try to find players better than you to play with. Maybe you find these guys in your matches who just seem to be really strong players, or maybe you go out of your way to find a community to play with. Generally if you put yourself out there you'll be able to find players who are better than you, and that's how you're going to improve faster. Because at the end of the day playing with people better than you is going to make things more challenging, and things that are more challenging always offer more for you to learn and grow from. What I highly suggest is that like I said before, if you encounter good players in your matches, add them, and then try to play a few matches with them. You never know who you'll meet along the way. Something else to keep in mind with people in Valorant is tip number 18 which is toxic players will never say anything useful, and this is in reference obviously to players who don't want to mute players because they might make necessary callouts. Remember earlier how I said that you pretty much have all of the information you need on your map? I mean don't get me wrong, there are some things that you can't get from your map, such as audio or your teammates intentions, but you can still kind of read your teammates intentions by just looking at how they're positioned, and you can also still see enemies on the map when they appear. So trust me when I say somebody who is being an absolute jerk to you is never going to start being like, hey I'm swinging this corner, can you trade me? Or I hear 4B either and spawn flanking you, this stuff just isn't going to happen. Trust me I have thousands of hours in this game now, rather than making helpful callouts what they're going to do is bait you and then they'll get upset with you after you die after they bait you. It's not worth it, just mute these guys and try your best to not only win the game, but enjoy the game. Because you shouldn't be letting some jerk on the internet run an experience for you that is supposed to be fun. Moving on to tip number 19 though, and that is you don't need to be a hero to climb. A lot of players have this really warped mentality that they need to hard carry every single game that they're in, but that's just not the truth. You have to play well, don't get me wrong, and I would say that you have to pull your weight, but if you want to climb, you need to do your job, and a little bit more. That should be your goal every single game. Don't expect to hard carry, and there are going to be games where you might actually have to hard carry to win. But if you want to climb, matchmaking should do a good job of balancing teams, meaning that all you have to do is pull your weight, and a little bit more. Like I said, this won't always be true, but most of the time it will, and this will prevent you from having the whole mentality where it's you versus the world because it's really not. You have four other teammates on your team that are all the same rank as you, so stop trying to act like a hero and just try to do your job. You'll be surprised how much this helps. Getting onto our last thing that I wish I knew when I started playing Valorant though, and that's that if you wanted to see how some of the best players in the game carry effectively in any rank, that is all available to you at skillcapped.com. For real, we just got a bunch of new radiant level players who are helping us showcase exactly how you can get out of any rank in the game, and this is also backed by a rank improvement guarantee, meaning that if you don't see the improvement, it's literally no risk.

Your friend, the one and only Keith Allen, I'm so pumped up. Because that's my job to make you guys the best Fortnite player you can possibly be. Oh yeah, and also the best person you could possibly be. You know, it's all about confidence. I'm what you guys have to have confidence. I know a lot of us struggle with confidence. But you know what? I want you to speak positive over your life. Speak positive. You know, over your mind and over your situations. And I promise you, you're going to see yourself get more confident day by day. I know because I struggled with confidence for so long. But I'm telling you you could do it. Listen, I'm so excited today because we're going to take this to the next level. All right, today we're going to give you guys a crash course in Fortnite. That's right, ladies and gentlemen, 30 tips back to back. Let's get to help you achieve better skills. All right, we've got a wide variety of tips. Some familiar, others new, and we're going to rapid fire them through your wall and into your box. So you guys got to get ready. But before we do, man, you guys got to taste my bunch of crunch. I'm telling you right now, I'm not trying to promote them. But I'm telling you, it is delicious. Check it out. My favorite candy is that bunch of crunch. Let's get this going. All right, guys, number one strategic planning. Always begin before players even drop. While waiting in the lobby, be sure to check the trajectory of the bus driver. This is going to let you know how close the path will be to your choice of landing spots. Be prepared to make adjustments as you see fit. Always have more than one possible landing spot. All right, number two. Landing spots can be contested or uncontested, depending on the meta and the benefits of landing at certain locations. Some players want to go for eliminations and will end up landing along with multiple others looking to do the same thing. Number three. Landing uncontested is sometimes lug base. Even if you find a nice landing spot with a few chests all to yourself, you know, always assume someone that would have the same idea. I mean, you may not be fighting the entire lobby, but all it takes is just one fast player reaching the loop first for your entire game plan to really fall apart. Trust me, I've been there. Number four. If you plan to use Chuck's Flash or Harvest Chuck Barrel, all right, try to wait to your shields. All right, 50, so you can just top it off. However, if you are in a fight and need the hills, then feel free to do anything you can do to survive in the fight. Number five. Seven vaults are scattered all across the island in a similar fashion to IO basis. You're going to need multiple players to open these vaults if you're playing solo. However, you can bypass the security check by just knocking down a guard and carrying them over to the scanner. Soon, you're going to be able to get your hands on all that loot, man. If you have no guards, chickens are going to work as well. Number six. The sniper rifle this season does not have a 200 damage headshot. So keep this in mind, guys, if you plan to use this weapon since it can just be easy to expect to really have that much damage causing you some confusion. If you land this shot, but don't make the kill. Regardless, like the snipers in excellent choice, for knocking down a good majority of your opponents health and really forcing them to really take the defensive. Are you going to need some accuracy for that striker pump, right? How about check it out, aim lab, by clicking on the link below. You know, with so many routines to choose from and even customize, you are guaranteed to see improvement in your aim. Don't believe us? Alright, aim lab has you covered with statistics on your progress that points out exactly what you need to be working on from mouse movement to keeping your crosshairs on opponents. Number seven. Another weapon with no 200 headshot is this striker pump. However, players have adapted by double pumping. This method is just sure way to use the new shotgun. However, it does require you to use up two inventory slots. Number eight. The auto shotgun deals even less damage and requires you to be in close proximity to your opponent to deal the maximum amount of damage. This weapon is best used when you want to strike quickly and swap out another weapon. Number nine. The ADS rifle, while recently nerfed, is still a great weapon for those peaking since the accuracy of the weapon allows you to get those shots in at an angle. So try just testing it out by creating a box with windows. And so it could be the key to really impossible peak shots I'm telling you. Number ten. Sometimes, you know, what you need are items from the vending machines or from various characters. Luckily, alright, in one of the most recent updates, the amount of gold on the island has been increased. Remember, gold does not carry over in competitive. So if you want to make sure that you make use of it, you need to take bounties, open chefs and eliminate enemies. Number eleven. The higher you are in the competitive ranks, the more often you're going to have to deal with storm surge. I'm telling you right now. So this is really because players are just more skilled at staying alive, which means the game must slowly eliminate those who deal with the lease amount of damage. As the storm closes. Luckily, you're going to lose health gradually, so you still have a chance to find an enemy, deal some serious damage, and get yourself out of storm surge. Number twelve. Slide cancelling does not increase your speed, alright? One of the misconceptions from sliding comes from the fact that it feels like just moving faster. Sliding will move you faster when you're going down a slope, and will definitely make you a harder target to hit. Number thirteen. Now, if you want to move faster while sliding, try doing it right as you land from a deployment, alright? Hold down the slide key or button while descending. Move forward or backwards to just build up momentum, and then finally, the moment that you touch ground, you should see yourself boosting forwards. Number fourteen. Alright, one of the common misconceptions and mistakes that you probably make is holding down the forwards button or stick when sliding forwards. The mentality behind that is, you know, just holding the stick allows you to keep sliding forwards. The truth is, man, that it really does nothing, and the slide will lose momentum at the same pace if you were holding it. So, you should break out of that mentality, and instead, use those free thumbs to perform other functions. So, this is also going to keep use of those same keys to do a complete 360 while sliding. Number fifteen. Alright, so now for some game stage tips. So, during the early game, the most important actions you need to keep in mind are choosing your spot, landing, reaching the loop quickly, and building up your mat inventory, alright? This is like the most hectic stage of the game since every player starts off with nothing. And you need to really find a weapon to defend yourself if you want to make it out of spot. Number sixteen. During the midgame, you're going to be rotating towards this center of the circle. You're going to need to outrun the storm and start building up your loop from rare status to legendary. The fights you encounter during this time will also give more intense as the outcome is more dependent on aiming and building rather than, you know, those who just reached the weapon first. Number seventeen. The late game will require you guys to keep building and keep trying to take the high ground. The high ground is your best friend, and when I only give you guys a good vantage point of the enemies below you, but will also make it easier to keep up with the storm. Number eighteen. The redwood trees will always fall towards the closest player, even if the trajectory of gravity seems to say otherwise. Like this will do 100 damage upon impact and can be useful for clearing builds. You can also keep hitting the leftover log to deal additional damage to enemies and builds. This time, the damage is based on momentum. Number nineteen. Alright, guzzle juice recently got buffed, making it a much quicker way to heal. However, the previous drawback of not being able to take damage is also an effect. This includes storm damage, which will cancel off the healing. On the other hand, fall damage will not have an effect on your guzzle juice use, and, you know, with the new buff, it just makes it easier to recover after taking fall damage. Twenty. Now, if you are looking to run through the storm while also healing, consider using medmiss since it can heal you in like the storm at 5 health per click. And it does allow you to move while doing so. This can create an extra protective layer that keeps your health nice and green as you try to outrun the storm. Number twenty one. Quad coppers are one of the best ways to rotate this season. With their signature boost, you can get great airtime when you practice boosting mid jump. It can get you around the map much quicker than a nama vehicle can, even with the all terrain tires. Number twenty two. Chilli Chug is available from Lama's, and there is a guaranteed spot near the Lama NPC at name and name. This Lama will always spawn there every game so you can use it to get max max and a variety of use fight ups. Number twenty three. For even more max, keep an eye out for that raft that spawns at the edge of the map. Each game, the spawn location is going to change, making it a dynamic POI. There, you can farm more than 100 wood from the mast alone and even harvest. Chug barrels, consumables from the non boxes as well as a guaranteed supply crate and henchmen chest. Number twenty four. Alright, so if you're having trouble finding the web slingers then don't worry guys, we got your cover. Alright, so first you need to drop down to the daily bugle and start exploring while keeping your eye on the walls. Eventually you should be able to find a backpack webbed up to the wall, interact with this, and it's going to drop the web slingers for you to use. Twenty five. Visual side effects have been buffed and turning them on will allow you to see all the sorts of activity from a distance such as Uncoming vehicles, players healing, and even the players themselves as they enter your proximity. One player who is currently using this system is Bouga and you can see why. I mean it offers a huge advantage and we recommend using this for as long as it remains this powerful. Twenty six. Invading boxes got easier this season with the new sliding mechanic. This requires you to deal some damage to the wall, you want to bypass, you know build a corner front of it, then slide down a game of momentum and knock down the wall. Do this correctly and you should be able to slide through before your opponent has the time to refortify the box. Alright guys, number 27. Speaking of destroying boxes, the SNG seems to be the goat to weapon this season. Due to its rapid, you know, rate of fire and damage. This has resulted in a spray and pray playstyle. We're knocking down a wall and dealing some damage because more viable. However, remember guys if you want to use this strategy, make sure that you have enough ammo to pull it off. Like, don't want to see yourself running out of mid-fight, right? And so if you need help not wasting ammo, you got to check out aim lab. Don't waste those bullets, land more shots and take down your opponents today. You can do it. Twenty eight. Consistency is more important than speed. Like if you're in a build battle or a box fight, you need to make sure that you're placing the right bills and the right places, right? Otherwise, there are no strategic methods to your builds and you are only doing so for the sake of building. So train your mechanics on creative to get the fuel for building and editing. Then find a sensitivity that's gonna allow you to have the most building accuracy. And as long as you know what you want to do while building, you're gonna have a clear path towards your goal. Twenty nine. Never forget what your capable love went down. Like you can actually perform multiple actions besides crawling. Like you can use the grapple one down to get away, but also you can use jump pads and webs to just bounce around. Also, like if you drop your inventory, you can lighten the load and move faster. Thirty. Alright, so one of the newest items, the Chuck sprinkler is a great way of keeping your team healthy. So if it has been released by the time this video was uploaded, then you're definitely gonna know what to do. Drop that sprinkler down and everybody benefits. Just be careful guys, not to heal your enemies. Bunch of grussami, that's gonna be it for today's video. Listen, be sure to leave a like, sub to the channel. Man, also feel free to leave a comment and just let us know if there's anything that you would be interested in learning more about. Man, I hope you guys appreciated these tips and I hope you guys use these to your advantage. I believe in you, I am your number one fan. The guy who's rooting for you, the one who is motivating you, man, each and every day your friend, the one and only, Keith, Alan, your motivation. I'll see you in the next one, peace.\"}, {'prompt': '', 'completion': \" I always have my eyes on a lot of pros on Fortnite. Essentially what this video is going to be is high IQ plays that not a lot of people do on Fortnite that I see pros doing a lot more. There might be one or two kind of basic things in here, but I truly believe that a lot of these skills and things that I'm going to talk about in this video are simply just not used in day to day play on Fortnite. I have roughly around 15 clips that I'm going to show you whether they're fast, whether they're slow, so the hope is not only by watching these will you familiarize yourself with these moves, and if you haven't seen it in a while you're going to retry that muscle memory and hop into your next game and use it. Don't forget to use codecat me the item shop, check out the merch link down below to support, and let's hop into this. I was watching this video and I saw a clicks box the player really really nice. It's a 2v1 and this guy has the wall on clicks and neck. What clicks did was he looked in the empty space to place a stair above that wall. That way he could break through the wall and the guy would be technically underneath the stair, the player would go in and he'd be full box. When I first saw this I was really surprised because it's a really unique way to box a player when you're trying to full send in their face. Most of these clips are for Mr. Savage because I always learn stuff when I watch his gameplay. I've seen him do this move lots of times but this is the one clip I found about it. Usually what people tend to do on Fortnite is edit open and do a 50-50. In this situation if you have a stair kind of blocking you and there's a guy on the opposite side of the wall, what Savage does is edit the bottom right four tiles just like this and then goes for peace control and now he's protected behind this little right hand peek. Personally in my experience of playing Fortnite I have never ever seen a player do an edit like this on me. That's why when I saw this I had a double take because it's super useful and super optimum. This next play that tons of pros use works surprisingly more than you think. This is one of the most basic ones I'm gonna talk about in this video but it's a fake outplay. Once he grabbed the wall he scuffed the edit so he acts like he's running away. Turning your character's body completely away from the enemy sometimes makes him think that you're gonna leave. This in turn lowers their guard a little bit and then that way he turns around doesn't edit and even though it's like a 50-50 he doesn't expect it and he gets the kill. Savage is a literal king at doing this move he does it all the time. I always tell people on Fortnite to make two boxes so that you could box fight a player outside that box. Being the aggressor you see how Mr. Savage dropped down on the wall he knows that lots of players make more than one box just like this. To outplay the situation you see how he doesn't drop down on the center of the wall. Once he takes the wall does the edit you see how he plays the angle so extreme to the point where the guy can't even shoot him back. It's really important to not just make the edit but play the angle too. This is a general reminder that I see pros do all the time and after they shoot someone if they don't hit them hard and they know that they're still gonna aggress onto the box. Lots of times what you see people do just like Mr. Savage did right here he shoots the player and since the wall is weak with any gun after he resets what he does is that he instantly tarps away after he makes the shot just in case the guy runs into his box. This gives him time to counter what he's doing and think about the right edit to make in this situation after. Not only that he buy himself time to get some heals up. Go out of your way to next time you get on Fortnite if you're not too good with it already to learn how to tarp away after you shoot someone or even when you get cracked. In slow-mo it looks like this. This is a very slept on play that I talked about in an old 100-tip video. What I see Mr. Savage do a ton in his arena fights. When he goes to drop down on a player's wall usually what happens is that a lot of average people what they're including me honestly will just drop down right on the center of the stair. This does work a ton for me especially if I keep the pressure up really nice at the start but nonetheless this move that I see Savage doing is something that I just kind of forgot about. You see how when he lands on the box he edits the stair in half. He missed time to floor so he had to reset it up again. Here it is when he side jumps. He smacks the wall once and then instantly looks down the place that counterpiece control before the other guy can. When he makes the edit he's behind the right hand peak. The red mogul's skin is literally looking clueless trying to figure out what's going on. I've noticed that a tendency that Mr. Savage has is that he makes his opponents kind of sit there behind an open edit. It's because he's doing things so fast and just so differently that it kind of confuses people. That's why I want to show you guys videos just like this where you can use other pros moves so that way you might be able to do the same thing like he's doing. Not only for you guys but for me as well because I need to start doing it. Similar move but in a different way. How many times have you tried the box a player but they end up being on top of the stair? He have edits the stair in the spot that they're on and then he can use that stair as a right hand peak to jump up and shoot them. He did it twice in the same play and then this was the last guy so he was trying to freestyle and do something crazy so he didn't end up going for the final shot but this is still a very viable option for you guys to do in your fight. This is how pros play arena and this is probably how you should be doing it as well. What I noticed Savage doesn't literally every pro. They always try to hop into the box the first few couple seconds the fight starts to happen. Even without the help the advantage and arena I tell people to do this all the time because it wraps up fights super fast but if you do struggle with learning how to jump in the boxes and ending fights quick this is probably the best way to go about it. Constantly trying to jump into the box at the very start of the fight is super super important because people don't know what to expect at the beginning of the fight. Usually how it works if you miss the first time jumping into the box then that player is going to be more defensive and it's going to be harder to jump in the second time. That's why pros who have mastered the jumping into box and just out aiming people get high kill games. That's all because they're really good at getting that first initial jump in on the box. The more you do this this play style of constantly just thinking you're going to have better aim than the other person the way better you're going to be able to get at the game because eventually you're going to learn the mistakes about what went wrong when you tried to jump in the box. After doing that for a long time you're going to realize exactly what you need to fix so that you can do it over and over and over and then you drop 20 bucks. Granite Deplay didn't work here but Savage knows exactly what he's doing. He's very good at making it seem like he's leaving that box. He jumps up off the cone but swings down at a very steep angle to try and wall replace the wall. If you're an average player and this is done to you the person inside the box might think oh he left so they'll stop holding the wall. This is just high IQ when Mr. Savage is playing. A move like this could work even against a very sweaty player. It was a fail and he ends up killing the guy anyway but this just goes to show that he does do this. This clip starts out he pre-fires, he peace controls, he goes crazy and the clip is looking real nice. Towards the end this guy is on his wall kind of spraying with an SMG. He thought that after he reset the wall there's only one wall in there that's not hit so if he could try and claim the peace control to where he thinks the enemy is going to go then he'll wrap up the kill but notice how he does it. He's on the cone and to be honest I never thought about using my walls like this. He jumps up over the cone to drag the walls over and down. That's a really unique way to get a wall on a guy and I think that's pretty optimal but the guy ends up spraying in his face nonetheless still a really good move. Here's a little trick that you might have missed to grab the wall before the other player even thinks about. What Savage does right here is as he's turning the corner he's looking down at a really steep angle. The average player might not be doing this but when you turn corners you kind of want to flick the wall into position. I think I can say that this is a very unique tip to try and grab the wall first before them. Have you ever gotten third party from the front end the back until the tower Savage is directly in the center of the map. People have eyes on him from everywhere but one thing he does that I've actually seen on the pros do as well. If you're getting shot from two positions instead of trying to spin around and place walls what people will do is place a wall in front of them and then turbo build a stair and a wall at the same time. It's constantly switching between the two builds. This blocks your front and your back but you don't want to sit there and think that it's going to hold forever obviously because bullets bleed through in chapter 3 especially but this is definitely a good way to stop a few bullets from hitting you. It just so happens that the second he tried to edit through the wall the stair broke and he took a lot more damage than expected. This is a move that even against pros will work so so well. He knows that there's a guy above the side jump that he's about to complete. What Savage is really really good at doing is pickaxing walls before anything else before any other builds are placed. He smacks the wall then places a floor and a stair to exploit in on the second pickaxe. This is something that once I saw it I thought oh my god I could do that myself but I never thought about doing it because I've never seen someone do it. Now that I have familiarized myself with it and so have you you should definitely try implementing this into your own game especially if there's a wood wall above that box. It's only two swings to hit and you'll jump right in before they even know what's happening to them. Here's a really good move that I bet a lot of people if you were in Mr. Savage's position right now but what lots of people including myself do sometimes. I'll edit a 50-50 and then place a cone and then just try and shoot the guy pump him and kill him. Mr. Savage attacks his edit by starting out the same way I would. Then instead of placing a cone he ramps the guy off with a stair. This pushes the guy into the back of the box because usually that player is going to be holding the right hand peek so it will always work. After that he doesn't edit but then backs up all the way to place a wall and then he can go for a different peek shot. Personally I think a better edit would be a top right hand corner edit because he did end up taking damage but that initial play of staring people off kind of like stiff orming them into the back of the box. It's definitely something that you should try and practice more often than just placing a cone and running in there with a 50-50. The pressure's on and Mr. Savage is in a box and a guy is pickaxing the only wall that he can escape from. Here's two things that he did super super well and one of those things that people tend to do is they rush it way too much. I've talked a ton about when a player pickaxes your wall. The second they get in front of their wall you can edit the spot where you think they're gonna swing and then you can shoot them as they're swinging. What I've noticed is that pros especially people like Mr. Savage they don't just wait for the guys to be in front of the box. It's almost like they hear the sound of the players swinging their pickaxe and then that's when they confirm the edit. The timing is impeccable. That was the first one. The second thing is that after he shoots the guy what I really like is that he shoots him and then prefires a stair first to block the guy off kind of stiff or I'm back in the box if he just so happened to be there. And then he placed a wall on top of that to try and mongo classic the whole thing and kill the guy quick. So when a guy comes up on your wall try to time it and listen for the pickaxe swing and then make the edit. Then afterwards if there's nothing in front of them try and turbo build a stair and the wall. In Fortnite especially pros are doing this a lot more in their fights. Turbo building two pieces instead of just one. Here's a quick move that lots of people probably know if you're really advanced. If you've been playing this game for a long long time chances are you might know what people tend to do on Fortnite nowadays especially pros when you're fighting them one-on-one. They look to get tons of angles on you but one thing you see is that as the player on high ground Mr. Savage looks for opportunities to place walls one box below him. Then he lands on a flat and then he tries to read where the guy is going but if it just so happens that he's still in front of that box he'll drop down and make a quick edit. What you should do when you're practicing your fights is get used to the building grid by trying to place walls one box below you. This is a great way to establish peace control and sometimes if they're building out of the same material that you place the wall out of they won't even realize that the wall is not there. So if we're both building out a brick and I turbo build a floor below me chances are the guy might not realize it until it's too late. This is some of the moves on Fortnite to definitely keep you up with the chapter 3 meta. Learning unique ways to build, edit, and peace control people it's gonna be one of the fastest ways you can improve at the game but it all starts with familiarizing yourself with just watching the video. That's my goal in every single youtube video I post is to help you guys get better in some way shape or form so drop a sub drop a like if this helped you. Shoutout to my man iClark for using my code in the shot. I'm gonna try and shout out one person with a screenshot every single time in a video because I'm trying to show my appreciation for the people they use my code. I'll see you guys in the next one.

Maybe it doesn\\'t matter or maybe it depends on your monitor.Pro tip #7: Bind autorun. I use Ctrl + Space (Sometimes it leads to me jumping when i spam it. I wish i could just double tap \\'W\\' like Arma 3.)Pro tip #23: With all? weapons the first bullet is always dead on, and then their is a huge jump before the automatic spray settles for about 4 more shots before drifting further, so don\\'t try to 2-round burst guns like the AK. I think WackyJacky recommends 5-round bursts also.Pro tip: #24: Watch WackyJacky videos. They cover every scope, weapon, and general topic you can think of, e.g. how to land fast with parachute.Pro tip: #20d: Backup your settings folder somewhere safe for times when the devs decide to wreck it back to default. The files themselves are located in %localappdata%\\\\TslGame\\\\Saved\\\\Config\\\\WindowsNoEditor\\\\ but i like to just copy the whole %localappdata%\\\\TslGame\\\\ folder to keep everything together.NOTE: Thumb Mouse Button -> the mouse side button closest to you. Thumb Mouse Button 2 -> the mouse side button farthest from you.1 - Pay attention to how you are playing in the moment, don\\'t \"Phase out\" and do what you\\'d normally do.To expand upon this point, imagine you are commentating over your own gameplay. Take note of everything you are doing mentally. Focusing a point to much? Identify that and change accordingly.The worst mistake you can make is trusting yourself to make the right call. You need to be your own voice of doubt. It\\'s better to run away from a fight than to die in one.2 - Pay attention to your surroundings, and get used to identifying positions by sound.One thing I use for training this is the following site ; https://www.pubg8x.com/gunfire?lang=englishYou want to get used to knowing exactly where you are being shot from by sound alone. If you hear a shot whiz past your head, you want to be able to look to where the shot came from and identify high risk points.Broken windows, sides of trees, tops of buildings, anywhere you would want to be if you were the shooter. The first step to winning a fight is finding out where your enemy is, the better you are at this, the better you\\'ll be at Pubg.3 - Risk assessment.You hear a massive gunfight in a compound nearby, what do you do?Take note of your weapons, meds, grenades and assess if you\\'ll actually stand a chance in those fights - No sense going up against a team with crate weapons if you only have a 1911.After you have made this assessment, survey the landscape, are there any elevated positions you can shoot from, or anywhere you can fall back for cover if they notice you? If not, it might be best to leave it alone.4 - Hotkeys.For the love of all that is holy, set hot keys for meds/grenades. Too many times have I died because I have accidentally clicked on the wrong med, or that few seconds that it took me was enough for me to be pushed.The faster you can heal, the faster you can get back into the fight.5 - Leaning.Get used to leaning around corners, or even in head-to-head gunfights.The more your head moves, the less likely that you are to be headshot. Avoiding that much damage will often be what wins you the fight.6 - Looting.Everybody knows a loot goblin. Most only need to look in a mirror to find one.If you hear somebody nearby and you don\\'t have a weapon, don\\'t go for the medkits. Grab a gun and rip them a new one, then go back to looting. Sure that helmet might look tempting, but it won\\'t matter if somebody is lining up a shot on you already.And unless you need to, never loot in the top 10. It\\'s a death sentence.7 - Stances.Did you know that crouching reduces horizontal and vertical recoil equally to the vertical grip? And going prone reduces it more than a fully kitted M4?Crouching should be your go-to stance in firefights, as its recoil reduction comes at a very low cost, that being, slightly reduced movement speed.Going prone is a fine art, as doing it at the wrong time will get you killed, but doing it at the right time will allow you to easily wipe full squads like swatting a fly.The right time to prone is when you have a visual on an enemy/group of enemies that haven\\'t noticed you. Ensure that you have visual on the maximum amount of people (1 in Solo, 2 in Duo, 3-4 in Squads).If you are confident in your abilities, simply prone, line up your shots and rip into them. Provided you were on target, either the entire squad or atleast half of it should be dead. That gives you the oppertunity to push on the survivors, finish off the downed, or retreat and reposition in the ensuing chaos.Never, and I mean never, prone in a direct firefight, you will be dead before you hit the floor.Pay attention to your surroundings and assess what stance is best for you at the time8 - Accepting defeat.You won\\'t win every game. Sometimes there are just too many random factors that you can\\'t take into account. Dying should not be a point of frustration, it should be a point of learning. Take note of how you died, and you won\\'t die to it again in the future.Even the best pro players only have a 25% win rate, that means that the other 75% of the time, they get their ass beat. Accept defeat for what it is and try again, don\\'t get angry, as that will only perpetuate any issues you have when playing. And when you spend too long doing the wrong thing, it makes learning the right thing even harder.'}\n",

            "[{'prompt': '', 'completion': \" Welcome guys, so in this video, I will give you 10 tips and tricks for the new Caracan map that you need to know as a pub G player And I hope it will help you to become a better player at this game Starting with the first tip, how to land faster, so usually in other maps you jump out of a plane at 800 meters But in Caracan, you need to make that jump at around 350 meters and then pull your joystick at a 45 degree angle Example like this, in this way, you will reach the maximum diving speed that is 234 kilometers per hour If everything goes right, you will land exactly at your marked location And in Caracan, you get an exclusive new weapon called Panzerfaust It's a one-time use rocket launcher or an explosive weapon extremely powerful and dangerous So in this video, I will tell you how to properly use the Panzerfaust But first you need to understand how powerful it is So the Panzerfaust will kill everyone under 4 meters of its explosive radius Sometimes it can kill even up to 5 meters of its radius So let me show you how much damage does Panzerfaust will deal So it's 0 to 2 meters the enemy will obviously die and at 4 meters the enemy will most likely to die If didn't die, then the enemy will lose 90% of their health and at 6 meters The enemy will lose 60 to 90% of health depending on the explosion and where you hit And at 8 meters, you deal 25% damage And remember this is just approximate values, the real one might deal more damage or less damage, depending on the explosion and situation So how to use the Panzerfaust, it's very simple, but sometimes it could be difficult But you just have to aim really close to the enemy and hit, mostly at the ground since it's more effective And do not aim for the enemy because if they move you will miss your shot, so always aim really close to the enemy and fire And in close range fights, don't be afraid of blowing yourself up because you only lose 25% HP with Panzerfaust explosion But your enemies will die immediately And also when you shoot Panzerfaust at your teammates, your teammates won't die, but they do lose 25% of HP just like you You can use Panzerfaust to shoot accurately up to 150 meters since it has 3 adjustment modes, 60, 100 and 150 meters All you have to do is aim at your enemy and mark the location, which will tell you how far as the target is, then click on the adjust button and adjust according to the distance and then fire The Panzerfaust is a really powerful weapon, it deals damage to targets within 6 meters of the impact point, so when shooting at really far targets you have to be really accurate since you get only one shot The Panzerfaust will spawn around Karakhan at really low rates and as for my experience, it seems to be more common in the hidden areas such as undergrounds and the few hidden buildings where you need to blast your way into to get inside Speaking of undergrounds, the only way you can enter these undergrounds is by a bunker and you need to have a C4 or sticky bomb with you to break into those bunkers Here is a tip about bunkers and always remember this thing, the bunkers with a flag on them will have an underground route so you can enter those But the bunkers with no flag will have no entrance to the underground, they are just bunkers which you can hide inside, but no underground, by the way, here is the location for the biggest underground tunnel, it located right here And another way to find it is to loot an air drop as it is at 100% guaranteed that you will find one Anyway moving on to the next Karakhan exclusive thing is sticky bombs which replaces grenades in this map so you won't find any grenades in Karakhan, you only find the Molotovs and Flash grenades Sticky bombs will deal damage to targets within 4 meters of the impact point Sticky bomb damages is shown here, it will kill everyone under 3 meters of its impact point and if you're at 3.5 meters you will lose around 70% of your HP and if you're at 4 meters, you will lose 25% of your HP and at 5 meters away, the sticky bomb will not deal any damage, its effective range is only up to 4 meters The red zone or the purple zone in Karakhan is a bit different than other one, it's called the Demolition Zone which will destroy some of the buildings randomly inside the red zone So if you find yourself in a red zone on Karakhan, I highly recommend you to get out of the buildings because this red zone will only destroy buildings and if you're inside one of them, you will directly get knocked finished immediately, your teammates won't be able to revive you Even if your building is not completely inside the red zone area, I highly recommend you to get out from that area before it's too late And here is a tactical tip for Karakhan, take those advantages of high grounds, such as buildings and mountains, use the high hills for your advantage, it's harder for the enemies to hit you, especially if you have rocks as your cover And also when doing a rotation or moving to the safe zone, travel from mountain to mountain, never leave the high ground advantage that you have, otherwise you will get stuck at low grounds I'd highly recommend you to go from hill to hill even if it takes longer, never go low hill And the last thing is, there are few walls in Karakhan which can easily be penetrated with gunshots, so be careful hiding behind those walls And also you can destroy the entire walls with a panzer-fost or a sticky bomb Anyway, that's all I got for this video I hope you learned something new, if you did hit the like button and

So I'm playing with Forza. After helping develop the Battle Royale concept for games like Armour and H1Z1, Brendan Green, known by his alias player unknown, was hired as a creative developer at Bluehole to realize his vision for the genre in his game Player Unknown's Battleground, which exploded into and is still currently considered the defining game of the genre, even though later Fortnite used 3-to-play concepts to surpass it in size and income. Today I'm going to give you 151 tips and tricks for PUBG. When you first sign up, you will be given the chance to choose a name and customize a character. A lot of players will tell you that the female character has a smaller hitbox and therefore gives you a tactical advantage, but the developers of the game have clarified that even though the girl character is smaller than the guy, the hitboxes are identical. Upon hearing this, some players will still push back saying that there might be a tactical advantage in choosing a girl because she is smaller and therefore harder to see, but since 99% of finding someone has to do with noise and camouflage levels, which are also identical between genders, these claims are at-fess and significant. After choosing your character, you will be brought to the menu screen. Before getting started, I recommend clicking on the settings button here to customize a few things. On the basic tab, enabling Amuses lets the game move the crosshairs for you a little bit, which I personally like, but it is not always helpful because enemies don't always move in the direction the game anticipates, which in those instances it can actually throw you off. Using the release option on these different firing modes gives you more precision when firing, but it also takes a while to get used to it, so I wouldn't recommend doing that unless you're an advanced player. I strongly recommend enabling peak and fire even if you're a new player because this is something you want to get good at eventually, but I wouldn't recommend selecting the whole to lean unless you're an advanced player. I keep all the other settings in this tab on their default, but it is important to note that auto-open doors can cause you to accidentally open a door at the wrong time, alerting nearby enemies to your location. In the graphics tab, setting the style the colorful will increase contrast and make it easier to see other players, and selecting a high frame rate will give your reaction time a slight advantage. This makes graphics the least important setting in this tab so it just it based on what your phone can handle. Since I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S7, which is becoming an older phone, I keep my graphics on the lowest possible setting and I keep all the other settings on default. In the controls tab, I recommend clicking the Customize button and adjusting your peak and fire buttons to be a little bit closer so you don't have to extend your thumb so far. I also recommend reducing the distance of the sprint button just a little bit and moving all of these buttons here on the right just a little bit closer to each other. Those are my favorite settings, but ultimately you need to find what works best for you. If you want to experiment with something, I recommend first trying it out in a new layout so that you can revert back to your old customized settings if you don't like it. You'll notice in my third layout that I have my shooting buttons at the top of my screen, because I bought these cool little trigger things for three bucks online from some company in China. I'm still getting the hang of them, but once I figure them out, I think having those two extra fingers will be a game changer. So if you want to try them, I'll put links to where to buy them in the description. I recommend disabling auto pickup because once you know what you're doing, it usually slows you down or crowds up your inventory. I keep all the settings on the other tabs at their default, but after you've been playing for a while, you might want to browse through them to see if you want to adjust anything. Now that we've talked about settings, let me touch briefly on the menu screen. You can customize all your game settings here, including perspective, server, modes, maps, teams, etc. Whatever you set here will be remembered and you will use those settings every time you click start. You can add friends by clicking on this button and then selecting the Add Friend tab and then typing your friend's name or character ID in this search bar. You can then invite those friends into your party using this button, but if you don't have any friends, the game will automatically select teammates for you. Joining a clan is a great way to find friends and forming a crew makes it easy to find your closest friends quickly. After you've played a few games, I recommend spending some time in the armory. The armory lets you see the stats on every single gun in the game and how that gun interacts with the various mods you can find for it. This is incredibly helpful for knowing which gun you want to keep on the battlefield. If you're free to play gamer, there are only two parts of the shop that apply to you. First one is the soldier crate. You can be bought for battle points which you get from logging in and playing the game. Missions for getting these points are either reset daily or weekly on Sunday at 6pm central standard time, which is also when the soldier crate price resets. The second one is the redeemed section. These items can be bought with the tokens you get for dismantling clothing duplicates. If you are not a free to play player, the best way to support the devs is to buy one of these elite season passes because they offer more rewards per dollar than any other offer. All of these other tabs are either not important at all or you will see a red dot when they do become important. So when you have everything set up the way you want it, click start. If you're playing on a team, the most important thing you can do is communicate with your teammates. In addition to an in game chat system, PUBG has implemented several ways to help a team communicate and work together. The first way is accessible by clicking on the mini map, this will pull up a bigger map. By clicking anywhere on this map, it will automatically set a marker that you and your teammates can see. This is helpful for a lot of reasons, but the most common thing this is used for is telling your teammates where you want to go. You can also click on this tab here which allows you to follow a teammate or invite them to follow you. This makes it really easy for your team to end up in the same place and reduces your chance of miscommunication. Lastly, if you do not want to use the voice chat, you can click the dialog button here, which gives you a ton of communication options. Some of these options have further meaning based on what you are pointing at when you use them. These in vehicles on the map are randomized each time you play, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't pay attention to where you got something, because certain places are more likely to give better weapons than others. If you get really familiar with an area, you will have a huge upper hand on someone that is just wandering around aimlessly. As a general rule, these areas have more and better loot, but most players know that, so they tend to be more heavily sought after. If you are playing a solo game, I strongly recommend avoiding these places if they are close to where the plane enters the map. All of the players are in the exact same plane as you, and most players have a tendency to exit the plane earlier. You can see which players have exited the plane by this number right here. If you are a confident player, I recommend finding one of these good locations that is off the path and marking it on your map. The maximum distance you can travel after jumping out of the plane is around 1500 meters. Some players will tell you that you can extend this distance by opening up your parachute early or slowing down your movement speed, but this is not true for PUBG Mobile, and using this approach just delays how fast you get weapons. If you are a less confident player, I recommend doing the same thing with one of these smaller groups of buildings that is off the path. There is no inertia in the game, so as soon as you jump off the plane, you can travel the opposite way of the plane just as far as if you were going with it. But I don't recommend doing that because other players that got off the plane earlier will get to the same destination faster than you, which means they will probably have guns by the time you land. As I mentioned earlier, the items are randomized, but if you find a location that has a lot of great stuff, it will probably have a lot of great stuff every time you go there. So if you are pretty new to the game, I recommend going to the same place as much as you can to get really familiar with it, which will give you a huge advantage over other players that aren't as familiar with that area. After the plane leaves the island, a safe zone will appear. It will be a circle covering about a third of the island, and a timer will start with 5 minutes. When this timer runs out, a radiation zone will start closing in on that circle. The radiation zone wall moves slower or faster, based on how far it is to the closest edge of the new circle. This means that if you are far away from the circle, the radiation zone travels significantly faster than you can run. The process of the radiation zone shrinking the first time also takes exactly 5 minutes. At this point, a new safe zone appears, and the process repeats itself for a total of 9 phases. Here are the main stats on each of these phases. For those of you who have been playing for a while, these numbers may not seem that important, but now that you know them, you will be surprised how often this knowledge will affect your decisions. Knowing details about what is going on around you in a game can often increase confidence and reduce indecisiveness. In the beginning, you don't have to worry that much about the radiation zone because it only does 0.4 damage per second. But this damage increases each round, so by the time you get to the end of the game, the radiation zone does 11 damage per second, which makes it incredibly important to be in the safe zone. For those of you who are used to playing rules of survival where you can spend the first half of the game in the radiation zone, you will find this much more difficult to do in PUBG. As soon as you land, find a gun with ammo as quickly as possible. People can tell when you don't have a gun and they will chase you mercilessly until you are dead. Once you have a gun, I recommend searching for a rifle and ammo. SMGs are a much better option than they were in rules of survival, but having a rifle is one of your weapons is still really important. Even what your average bullet per kill ratio is, and then unless you have a really nice backpack stop gathering ammo after you have enough to kill 8 people. I promise that by the time you've killed those 8 people you will have found more ammo. If you see the shooting icon, don't assume they're shooting at you, but look around to see if you can find them. If you see them and they don't see you, don't attack them unless it's an easy kill. Long battles attract a lot of attention and should be avoided. Stay near buildings so that if you start taking damage and you don't see them, you can just run around a corner to buy you some time and set up if they chase you. Now if you're still in bronze, most of the players you will be fighting are AI players, which are really easy to kill. Do not let this easy competition make you develop bad habits. Try to always fight from a position where you have cover and if you don't have cover, try to get in the habit of moving while you shoot so that you do not become an easy target. Even if the player you're shooting does not see you start moving within 2 seconds after first firing your gun because if you shoot at someone while you are not in cover, it will likely attract the attention of someone else nearby and standing in the middle of the field will get you killed really quickly. So get in the habit of moving while you shoot every time you engage when you don't have cover to hide behind. If you're playing a team game, the most important thing you can do in the very early stage is stay close enough to your teammates so that you can support each other while you're looking for items. If you're playing competitively then you should have a good team and if you have a good team, then you should live or die as a team. Playing 3 vs 4 in a competitive game is stupid, especially because it's so easy to avoid. You also want to be on the lookout for good armor, helmets and backpacks. Level 3 items are the best in the game but they are also rare. Level 2 items are attainable but don't spend too much time trying to get all level 2 pieces. You can see what level your gear is from how many bars are here. Once you have some decent gear, you have several options on what to do next. PUBG is a multifaceted game. You get points for killing people, doing damage, getting supplies, surviving the longest and even get points for taking damage and then healing yourself. This gives you lots of options on how to play this game. If you want to know the 4 main strategies for how people play PUBG, I recommend checking out my video that lays out the pros and cons of all 4 of them. The only tactic that I don't mention in that video is the car rampage tactic. Using a car is your weapon is very effective. So much so that there are some players that are able to win solo games without ever shooting a gun. That tactic is a great option as is all the tactics I mentioned in that video and if you're going for points you should do whichever one best fits your strengths as a player. But in this video I'm going to be focusing on how to get first place. PUBG is not just a shooter game. You can be fun to play it that way and you still get lots of points doing it but if you want to get first place often you have to get out of that mentality. PUBG is also a survival game. Shooting a gun attracts attention and attention is a great way to die. If I see someone and they don't see me but I'm not in a good enough position to kill them and take on someone else that hears me kill them I just let them go. In fact if I'm really playing competitive like I'm trying to get first place every time I often just watch people for most of the game and only kill when I really have a good read on where everyone is at. The best place to hide is in tall grass on high ground near a rock or tree. For those of you who saw my rules of survival video my tactic where I hide in one of these little sheds with a shotgun is not nearly as effective in PUBG because it's not as easy to one shot someone so I seldom use this tactic when I'm playing PUBG. I still love using shotguns and I see a lot of pros use them in urban combat but I don't use the shed tactic. Now when you're part of a team there's no reason to hide because a well-positioned team that works well together can kill dozens of players without ever receiving a single casualty. The team simply has to make sure that they position themselves in a place that they can fight in any direction with little to moderate repositioning. They also need to make sure that they are close enough to each other that they can revive downed enemies without being exposed. The team that works well together under those conditions is almost invincible. A solo person however is not especially in PUBG. A lot of players are really good with a car 98 so drawing too much attention can be the end even if you're a really good player. If you are pushing hard for the first place position I recommend using one of these two tactics. If you find that you are already in the new safe zone when it appears I recommend staying in your hiding place for as long as you can. Look around to see where people are but don't kill anyone unless you are confident that you can kill them within 2 seconds of first firing your gun. Look at them if they are close but be super wary of other enemies since you just fired your gun. Even firing a gun with a suppressor will still alert enemies if they are close enough. In a team game if you shoot someone and they die without getting knocked down first then that means that all of their teammates are already dead. But if they get knocked down first instead of dying that means that at least one of their teammates is still alive and the guy you just knocked down can communicate your position to his teammates even after you kill him. So you want to kill him as soon as possible so his teammates don't revive him but you also want to be cautious when it happens and stick close to your teammates. It is incredibly hard for someone to see you when you are crawling in the grass if you are on high ground. But if you are on lower ground than them high grass is almost worthless. If you are on high ground and stay still people should not be able to see you unless you are within 7 meters or closer. If you find yourself outside of the new safe zone when it appears I recommend waiting as long as possible. You can run from cover to cover if you are careful to look around while you do it but I recommend giving other players a chance to get to the safe zone first. This might seem like horrible advice because a lot of players talk about killing people as they run to the safe zone but once you try it a couple times you will notice that that happens rarely. In PUBG most players die when an enemy notices them first. That enemy then fires at them when they are in bad position and they have very little chance of winning the fight. By letting other players go first you will find that you often see other players before they see you. In fact most of them will never see you because their back is turned to you most of the time as they run to safety. Usually by the end everyone is calling around at a field and behind cover and it is very hard to see them. If you are part of a team and there are no buildings in the safe zone I recommend spreading out about 4 to 8 meters from each other. This makes you close enough to support each other but far enough away that enemies will probably only see one of you at a time. If you are playing solo stay hidden as long as possible. Remember this tutorial is about getting first place so ideally you only have to kill one person to win but the closer you get to the end the harder it is to not run into someone. When you see someone get close kill them while you still have the advantage of shooting first then slowly crawl away from your kill while looking around because the loot box is noticeable from a distance and your enemies will likely be looking for you to loot your kill. When you are down to the last two the safe zone is usually pretty small right now. I am not very good at throwing grenades so I have usually saved up about 5 or more grenades at this point. If you see the other guy but they are in cover chunk all of your grenades at them. Remember to wait a second or two before throwing it so they don't have as much time to run away but obviously don't wait 3 seconds or you will be giving them an easy win. Even the more likely scenario you do not see them but the safe zone is very small I recommend throwing one of your grenades at every tree and rock that is in the safe zone. This is kind of a controversial tactic because if they are close enough they can hear you pull the pin on your grenade and if they are watching they will either see you or the grenade in the air which will let them get an idea for where you are at. And I agree with those objections in theory but in practice I find that this tactic almost always works out to your favorite because the grenades usually get people to come out of their cover or reveal where they are and I only do this when I have a really good position. So in my experience it either works or they weren't in cover because they were crawling on the grass and it doesn't seem to have an effect either way. So I recommend trying it out for yourself and see if you can land the first place spot. In addition to those 99 tips and tricks I have 52 more for you. There seems to be a lot of confusion even among advanced players on how boost items work. I hear a lot of people say that energy drinks give you movement speed but painkillers do not. That is not true. Energy items do not give you any benefits in and of themselves. Rather they give you points towards your boost meter and your boost meter gives you benefits. It's important to think this way because if you don't you will get confused. There are very advanced websites out there that say things like energy drinks will restore 23% of your health. That is not true. If you use an energy drink well it can heal up to 52% of your health. Here's how the boost system works. When you use a boost item it gives you a percentage of your boost meter which diminishes over time. This meter consists of a total of 5 minutes. Energy drinks give you 40% of that meter which is equal to 2 minutes. Energy drinks will give you 60% which is equal to 3 minutes and the adrenaline syringe gives you 100% which covers the whole 5 minutes. You get different benefits based on how much boost you have in your boost meter. So using an energy drink by itself actually only heals 22% of your health. But that is not the best way to use an energy drink. If you use a painkiller and then an energy drink that same energy drink will heal 52% of your health and give you a move in speed bonus of either 2.5 or 6.2% based on which bar you are on. And then after 2 minutes when your bar drops back down to 60%. You can use another energy drink to get another 52% of your health back and have another move in speed bonus. So that's how the boost system works in PUBG. If you want to know more about my strategy on how to maximize this system to your advantage be sure to check out my video titled How to get double healing from energy drinks. To just recently added the flare gun into the game you need to aim towards the sky in order to use it. Using it outside the safe zone will spawn an armored vehicle and using it inside the safe zone will spawn a special air drop with twice the normal loot. The developers never actually added infrastructure to these towers so you cannot land on them no matter how hard you try. But there is a way to use the lean function to get a little bit up this tower. While clearing a house or going around a corner you can use your third person camera to peek around the other side which is an effective way to stay safe while scouting. While driving a vehicle you can see its health and fuel bar shown here. You can also tell when one of your tires has been destroyed because the corresponding icon will turn red. Peek as much as you can even when you're in a house but remember that staying inside a house can sometimes become a death trap if you are up against a player who is skilled with grenades. While shooting through a window or any small hole you will notice that you do not always shoot where your crosshairs are. Remember to leave more space below your aim so that you don't hit the wall in front of you while you are shooting. Short grass will actually disappear once you are more than 150 meters away from the grass so don't try to hide in short grass. Zooming in doesn't just magnify it allows you to see as if you were actually closer. So some players will appear that weren't previously visible. Unlike most other shooter games PUBG has implemented a bullet drop for every gun so remember to aim high when trying to shoot longer range shots. Especially on guns that do not have a high range stat. This is again where the armory is particularly helpful. If you unequip all your weapons you can run much faster. If you do this your character will move 6.3 meters per second so that's a good way to measure how long it will take you to reach the safe zone. If you're too far from the circle try to look for a vehicle. You can usually find them along roads. You can use downed enemies as bait to get their teammates to come try to revive them but make sure you kill them before they reach cover. I personally like to put all of my guns on single fire mode. I find that the extra headshots more than make up for the slow rate of fire. If the safe zone covers the outer sea you can swim away from the shore and survive a really long time but doing this will probably make it more difficult to get first place because you have to get back to shore before you can fire your gun. You can't heal beyond 75% health level except when you are using med kits, energy drinks, pills or the adrenaline syringe. While the crossbow and pubg looks awesome and it can one shot an unarmored enemy even with a body shot which can sometimes make it useful in the initial scramble it is actually a terrible weapon. It has a long reloading time and you get one shot at a time. The only thing that's good about this weapon is that it makes absolutely no noise. Always choose a pan over other melee weapons it has higher damage and it can block bullets. I know this is a tip for doing better at the game but I strongly recommend checking out the Viva Lidert League YouTube channel. I'm pretty busy with work and family and I don't have time to watch a lot of YouTube channels but I watch and like every single pubgie video these guys make and several of their other series. Just watch this one video from them and then when you fall in love with them remember that JCF was the one that sent you. Smoke grenades are useful for reviving a teammate or repositioning but remember to throw them quite a bit in front of the area that you were trying to cover because they don't cover the area immediately near where they land. Please pay attention to your mini map even when you're using a scope to see where your enemy is shooting from. Audio is really important this game since a lot of noises like opening doors, looting, healing, pulling the pen on a grenade, a thrown grenade and most footsteps do not give these notifications. If you are wanting to play competitively I recommend using a good headset so that you not only hear those noises but a good headset will help you identify where those noises are coming from. Here you have full health before getting into a fight and using painkillers and boost right before engaging an enemy is a great way to give yourself an advantage in a fight especially at the end of the game when options are the most limited. Wearing darker clothes like black shirt, black pants etc is best for the main map, airing out but they make you easier to spot in Miramar. Natural colors like yellow and gray are the best if you want to play on that map. Like I said earlier I almost always put my weapons on single shot but this is especially important if you are trying to shoot someone from far away because the recoil of the gun is magnified the further distance you shoot. When you are parachuting down use the eye icon to see how many players and teams are dropping at the same place as you. After you kill someone don't just stand there and loot their body that's a great way to get snipe. Just grab what you can within one second and then get out. When you get shot at never ever ever start crawling or crouching. This is a very common new mistake. Having and crawling is helpful for hiding behind cover and not getting notice in the first place. They actually make you an easier target because they make you go slower. Always use the left fire button when using a scope because you will need your right thumb to aim. When you want to show your teammate where an enemy is at just move your crosshair over the enemy and then click the enemy ahead dialogue in the chat. Having scopes with higher magnification is always more useful than a lower one but do not equip a six time scope or higher on both of your items or it will severely weaken your close quarter combat. Moving silently in PUBG is a lot more difficult than rules of survival. So if you are playing a solo game I don't recommend staying too long in buildings. Using the boost option for vehicles requires a lot more gas and creates more noise so I don't recommend using it unless you are getting shot at or trying to outrun the radiation zone. When there are only two people in a car sit on the same side so the driver can position the car as a shield in combat. While you are swimming pay attention to your lung function. If it is turning red that means the game is thinking that you are still submerged in water even though your character looks like it's not. Pressing crouch will let you submerge into water and jump will allow you to surface. If you are trying to get to the safe zone or escape an enemy fire by swimming submerging is a great way to increase your safety. Bullets can penetrate water but the damage is significantly reduced. You are also obviously harder to spot when you are underwater. And then lastly if you are pretty new to the game I recommend avoiding motorcycles because they can be pretty difficult to master and it is much easier for other enemies to kill you. Well that's it guys hope that helps. Obviously compiling that was a lot of work so please remember to like this video if you did in fact like this video and if you liked it a lot can you please share it on your Facebook and Discord groups so that more people can see it. JCF is a pretty new channel and it really helps me grow. Alright guys I'll see you next time.\"}, {'prompt': '', 'completion': \" Welcome guys, in this video I will show you top five amazing tips and tricks that you need to know as a PUBG player and I hope it helps you to become a better player at this game, starting with the first one in school apartments, so this trick is to surprise attack your enemies who are in this exact same apartment building. For example, you have your enemies holding on this exact apartment building while you're on this one, as shown in the video, this is like one of the most common situation in school apartments. Most people usually attack them by going through the stairs which is extremely dangerous because you have no idea where the enemies are camping, that's why using this method will most likely help you to kill them easily. You have to do the following process in order to make that surprise attack, first you need to jump on this rooftop of your enemies apartment in this way. And now go towards the corner of the rooftop as shown here, now you need to jump in order to climb up the small wall of the rooftop's edge example like this. And now look towards the window and then go forward or move your joystick towards the window example like this, there are few things you need to make sure before you do this, you need to stand on this edge of the wall exactly as shown here, otherwise you might fail to enter inside the window. And the next thing, when you move towards the window, you will either slide into the room like this or you will get stuck at outside of the window like this, you just need to hit the climb up to get inside, so I would recommend tapping the climb button when you're close to the window so you'll automatically climb into the room. By the way, this trick works on other sides as well. And similarly you can also do the same thing in open rooftop apartments, while your enemies are rushing from stairs, you can easily surprise attack them. And also if you know there is someone below you, you could throw grenades, it will work extremely good if you properly cook them until timer is at 2-3 seconds. Moving on to the next tip, it's for TDM players, so you most probably aware of this camping spot, or at least got killed more than once from here, so I will show you a grenade lineup that will most likely kill the campers at this spot. To throw the grenade you need to come right at this exact location, and from here, you need to aim for this exact spot with your crosshair, and now jump throw the grenade, if you do it perfectly it will land near the enemy and blows up. Few things you gotta make sure while throwing a grenade is to cook the grenade until the timer reaches 4 seconds, and then when you're jump throwing it, first, release your grenade, or release your finger from the fire button, and then hit the jump button, your grenade will land perfectly near the enemy, and you will get the kill. If you jump and release the grenade at the same time, it may not work, because you have to release the grenade first and then jump. By the way, there is a new arena map, and I have a grenade lineup on this map, usually people camp in this spawn location in this map, so in order to throw the grenade over there, you need to do as followed. So you need to come near this container, and align yourself example like me. Make sure that you're leaning towards right side, and now aim with your crosshair at this spot, and most importantly cook the grenade until timer reaches 3 seconds, and then simply throw it. And the grenade will blow up exactly as it reaches spawn location. This grenade will most likely kill, or damage anyone who are camping at this spawn location. Now to the next tip, this is kind of opposite of first trick, so you're in this school apartment, while your enemies are on this open rooftop apartment. And if you try to throw grenade from here, it's really hard, because if you throw it will either fall off from the apartment or you will get yourself knock while throwing it, so let me show you a safe and best way to throw grenades in this situation. First thing, get on the highest floor, and then go into the specific room, and then climb up the window frame in this way, and yes don't forget to switch to FPP first person. So from here your enemies can't see you and you can't see them, but how can we throw a grenade from here? That's why we rely on certain spots to aim, so you need to place your crosshair at this spot, while throwing the grenade example like this. And cook the grenade until timer reaches really close to two seconds mark, and then throw it, it will blow up right on your enemies rooftop. Cooking the grenade is really important, if you don't cook it properly, then it will most probably go near the stairs area, if you cook it perfectly then it would blow up right in the air at this location. Anyway, that's all I got for this video, I hope you learned something new, if you did hit the like button, and subscribe for more upcoming videos like these, enjoy my bot gameplay, see you guys in the next one. I never say, I'm a fool, to that light, but every time I try to breathe away, kill me, will I love, and I have faith. So I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die, I'll stop that I don't die, just have you die. So I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die, just have you die. I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die, just have you die. When I choose doubt you, I'll just get out of here. I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die, I'll stop that I don't die. So I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die, just have you die. I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die, just have you die.\"}, {'prompt': '', 'completion': \" Welcome guys, so in the new update, we have a new mode called Traverse Insected. You can become an insect in this mode, and also there is a new glitch to get unlimited amount of flare drops. You can get as many as flare drops with this glitch, which I will show you later in this video on how you can get unlimited flare drops. But first let me give you introduction on this new Traverse mode. The first thing you would notice is that there are five new icons in the map, those are labs, or research center, you will get a decent amount of loot here. But currently they are hot drops, so most people will land here, and finding a gun is big challenge, if you're lucky you might get one. And when you're in the lab, there is this machine which is going to make you smaller, you need to get inside of this machine, and then click on the Transform button, now you will transform into a small insect example like this. But sometimes when you click on the transform, it just disappears, if it does disappear for you, then turn off your gyroscope, and now try again, but when you're transforming you need to make sure that you don't move, if you move even slightly it's going to cancel the transformation, so you have to stand still until the transformation is completed. And there is a glitch to get unlimited number of flare ammo, for this you need a flare gun, you don't need the ammo, if you do have it, then drop it on the floor, and now go into the machine, and transform yourself into an insect. And go out from the machine for a second, and get back into the machine, and transform into your normal form, now you will get the flare gun with ammo in it, and you can do this as many times as you can. But sometimes it says excessive use of transformation device places a heavy burden on the body, please try again later, so after about 10 or 20 seconds later, give another try, you will transform into an insect. And then transform back into the normal form, and enjoy the flare drops. By the way, this is a glitch so by the time you're watching this video, this glitch may or may not be working, so it's not 100% guaranteed that this glitch will work, but I will keep it updated in the comment section, and when you turn into an insect, you will get a tiny rocket launcher, or whatever that weapon is called, and you can shoot an unlimited amount of bullets, but it doesn't really deal that much damage when you're shooting a normal human player. It does like 5% damage, and sometimes 10% when you headshot them, so it's kind of useless shooting at normal human players since it doesn't deal good amount of damage. But when you're fighting against other insect players, your rocket launcher will track the enemy, and deals a really good amount of damage, it takes on average two shots to kill them. But the most annoying part is that, shooting at these tiny enemies, or insects is really really hard, I mean I miss all my bullets, because these insects are so tiny, and also I think that aim assist doesn't work on the insects, so it's gonna be even harder to kill the insect player, unless you become one yourself. So I would recommend using explosives such as grenades, as they are more effective to kill the insectoids. And also you can use a gas can explosion to kill insectoids, bait them into coming near a fuel can, and blow it up, it will deal a huge amount of damage to the tiny insects. And also the spawn rate of the pans and labs are very high, so you can use those to hit the insects, and one single hit with a pan will kill the insectoid, so if you are an insectoid stay away as possible from pans, and now to the teleportation, you can teleport through a portal from one lab to another lab, but only possible when you're an insectoid, or tiny insect. And when you become an insect, or insectoid you can collect some dust particles, or the luminator, which you can use them later, to buy stuff from the luminator shop, you can buy armor, health, guns as well as air drop weapons and a lot of stuff. If you go out from the lab while being an insect form, you will see a red zone, it kinda looks similar to blue zone, but it's actually a quantum field, if you cross that area, you will lose your ability to maintain the insectoid form. And after 10 seconds you will turn back into the normal human form, if you're flying too high you might fall down, and die due to the fall damage, so be careful of that. So you gotta remember few things, the lab will stop working, if you're in a blue zone, you can transform yourself into an insectoid north teleport, so the lab stops working in blue zone, and use explosives such as grenades, gas cans are the pan to kill insectoid enemies it's much easier, and lastly the unlimited flare ammo trick, not just works with flare guns, it works with almost any weapon. By the way, follow me on my Instagram, I will be posting short videos on it. Anyway, that's all I got for this video, I hope you learned something new, if you did hit the like button, and subscribe for more upcoming videos like these, see you guys in the next one.\"}, {'prompt': '', 'completion': \" Welcome guys! In this video I will give you 20 amazing tips and tricks that you need to know and they may help you. So let's get started! Moving Vehicle Seat Swap! When you see an enemy while you're driving vehicle, you can swap your seat and star shooting. By doing this, you may lose some of your critical accuracy, but it's still better than jumping from a moving vehicle and losing 80% of health. You may need to be careful while doing this because your vehicle will hit the brake when you swap seats and eventually stops moving, which makes easier for enemies to kill you. So it's better to get down from the vehicle and find a cover. Speaking of cover, you can use your vehicle as cover in some situations. But there's a gap between tires from this gap you can get shots, so it's better to burst the tires and use the vehicle as cover. Now I think you might be safe from getting shots from below the vehicle. This vehicle is still usable, but not as fast as before. And also this depends on vehicles. Make sure you only burst two tires on the same side or it might be tough for you to travel. Or sometimes you don't need to burst the tires, it depends on the situation. You can kill people by shooting from below the object, like a fake car in boot camp, or in military base bridge and many more. This trick works only when legs are visible. So yeah, you should be careful while camping behind objects like these. Do you know that painkillers wait the same amount as the first aid kit in your backpack? Do you think the first aid kit will be much heavier? But the painkiller is quite heavy in your bag. Painkiller is worse boost item in my opinion because it takes up a lot of space in your bag and extremely long to use and also not very efficient. I recommend carrying energy drinks because you can take two energy drinks and it doesn't take as much space in your bag as a painkiller and gives you a little bit more boost than a single painkiller. There are actually two ways of crossing this river near a boot camp, one is from water and another one is using a bridge. You can cross this river by swimming underwater, speaking of underwater you can stay up to 18 to 20 seconds underwater and sometimes you can make it without losing health, sometimes you may lose some health. So swimming underwater is safe and harder for enemies to spot you in water. If you get knocked in the water you'll die instantly, so be careful while traveling from water or while crossing rivers. There is a jump near a boot camp that you can easily do with a bike but with a scooter, maybe you can make halfway through and swim. If you ever made this jump with scooter, then let me know in comments. Most people don't like using a bike because it can easily get flipped but the bike is the fastest vehicle and also a less secured vehicle. You can balance the bike with those up-down controls, so in case if you ever need to use bike use those to control or balance the bike from getting flipped, just like in hill climb racing. Moving while healing is extremely helpful, I think most players know this by now. If you played for more than one season you will get used to moving while healing, it just saves your life if any shots are coming in and make it hard for enemies to shoot at you. And the next tip is for gyroscope players only. Having a different sensitivity for sniping and spraying is really helpful. Change your sensitivity when you want to snip and change it back to normal after. This may be hard at starting, but you'll get used to it. If a bike is about game mechanics, your right peak actually exposes less of your body, then left peak does. It's basically the way the character model works, left peak is going to reveal more of your body means bigger hitbox and more chances of getting hit than if you right peak. And also right peak gives you more field of view, then left peak. You're not saying that never use left peak in certain cases you should do it because it's the only choice, but keep in mind your body exposes a lot when you left peak. Do yourself a favor by having the same weapons in the same slot every time? Let's say you're carrying M4 and a sniper and you have M4 and slot 1 and sniper and slot 2. In that way whenever you want to snipe someone, you will know sniper is in slot 2 and also it gives you muscle memory to understand easier. Whenever you want to spray down enemies from 100 meters or higher, try to use crouch and spray. By crouching your recoil will be reduced a little bit and increases your accuracy. So try to crouch more often to get used to doing it regularly. And if you can't able to control recoil and enemy is so far, then you prone and start shooting, by using prone, your recoil will be reduced almost half, I think so, and it will be harder for enemies to shoot back at you because of smaller hitbox. And maybe sometimes crouching and pruning might be useful in the close range too. You can easily survive all of the zones up to above 5, that's when you should probably think about getting in but when you get stuck in the gun fights in zones like 2, 3 or maybe 4, it's not a good idea of fighting in the blue zone, but with enough health kits and full boost, you can definitely outlive your opponents, there are gonna move or they gonna die under the blue zone. And you could stay safe or at least alive, but by 5th zone, you should be getting in. Whenever you are trying to do the third party to someone, if you see someone not just confirm those kills, you'll get those kills, not the enemy who not them, it's like stealing kills, but worth it because you are getting free kills by stealing their kills. Cooking those nades is probably one of the most important things to learn, however, you want to learn it either going training grounds or count in your head and getting lucky, if I start throwing nades behind that house, those guys will have plenty of time to get away, however, if I cook it perfectly, and this guy will die and not stand a chance of getting out. So do yourself a favor by getting really good at cooking these nades because they make you a better player. And next thing is pre-fire, pre-fire plays an important role whenever you want to push, do it with a pre-fire it always helps and do it more often to get good at it. The more you play the more common hiding spots you know. If you have intel on someone's position you should pre-fire obviously since you are already putting shots down range and the person is still reacting. On defense pre-fire as well, when attackers try to push an object it will make them hesitate or slow down and cancel out their peeker's advantage. If you don't have intel of someone being in a room but you are still clearing it, just quick peek the room look for someone, and if you do see someone pre-fire on the re-peak. Otherwise, just quick peek and pre-aim every angle as you go. I wouldn't worry too much about giving away your position since most people know what's going on without having confirmed intel. Most people check everything anyways. Having more than three smoke grenades will definitely help you in the final circle. When you want to loot a crate during an open battlefield, use smokes. When you want to rush into a building from open ground, use smokes. When you want to make enemies full with a fake grenade, use smokes. So here in my case, I'm rushing in the open field and I use few smokes to give me good a cover and distract them. Try to use the highest sound settings for headphones or earphones, which makes easier for you to listen to enemies footsteps and locate them easily. Gun sounds will be loud at starting, but if you keep on playing on highest sound settings you'll get used to it. And finally having a great game sense, for example, some people who are new to the game will prone in the grass, thinking that they are safe and covered up by all the grass, well they don't understand that grass only renders about few hunters of meters, so my enemy is almost 100 meters away. And he thinks that proning in the grass is safe, but from my angle, I cannot see any grass because it does not render that far. So how to improve your game sense? Well by playing and understanding how game works, the more time you spend on the game, will increase your game sense, and also try to watch some e-sports, which will give you some more details about game sense, and how pro players play.

Bye bye.\"}, {'prompt': '', 'completion': 'I went from 150adr 3% win rate to 300+ with a 18% ish win rate in a season. Here\\'s what I did.Care about your stats. Look them up every game and go to your replay section to see your damage and what your rank is. I used to not check so dying was kinda \"whatever\" to meUse the training range. You rarely shoot in pubg because everyone is scare to shoot. So use the training range and fire off thousands of shots. This will improve your game play dramatically.The current meta is ar+DMR in Vikendi/ sanhok and at+Sr/DMR in Miramar and erangel. I personally prefer ar+dmr. So I fired off hundreds of rounds with the sks and m4. I used to hate the sks but now I can\\'t wait to find one. You need to get really good at both of these guns and know what situations to use them in.Stop hot dropping. There is way too much RNG/lag to ever consider hot dropping to be a viable strategy. Always drop without anyone near you and if someone tries to land with you in that compound in the middle of nowhere. Run.Learn to full auto spray. My ar rarely leaves full auto nowadays. If they\\'re out of the range of my full auto range then my DMR is more useful. Learn to spray in the practice range at 10-100m. As well learn to use the 2x instead of holo and red dot. The 2x is superior to those sights.Never ever ever ever run off from your team. Always be able to see them. Don\\'t be a \"hero\" and try to get that kill. The most op thing in this game is teamwork !Reflect on your deaths. Think about why you died and lost. Were you not behind cover? Did you get caught out in the open? Did you forget to put your gun in full auto ?Don\\'t blame your teammates. Did they tell you the guy was behind the shed and he wasn\\'t? Did they not knock the guy before you got killed? Whatever the case it\\'s a game and positivity is better than negativity!Find a good squad that you like and can win withPositioning and cover is way more important aiming well and strong guns.The number 1 thing is to always be self-reflective about your play, no matter how good you are. Even the best of the best are often thinking about what they could have done better. Learn from your mistakes and realize that there are pretty much always things you can improve on. Even when you have success, think about what you could have done better. Think about your weaknesses and consider what you can do to improve upon them. If you feel like you have too many and are overwhelmed, focus on one or two things that you can do better, and work on them.Maybe you struggle with communication. One example that I\\'ve recommended to teammates is to improve their communication by using a standardized callout system of direction, distance, description - so if they hear a gunshot, they\\'d say something like \"300 degrees, maybe 100 meters, rock to the left of the gray tree\". Maybe instead you have trouble telling where shots are coming from once combat starts. Practice by identifying the direction of distant shots that aren\\'t being fired at you. Call out the compass direction of every shot you hear. Maybe you are bad at driving. Go into training mode and grab a vehicle and work on mastering the vehicles off-road. Again, as long as you are actively identifying your mistakes and weaknesses and taking pro-active measures towards addressing them, you will improve as a player.Reaction time is going to be built up through repetition and experience. However, you can accelerate your anticipation skills and your game sense by constantly thinking. Play the circle. Think ahead about where people are likely going to be coming from based on the map, how the circle changes, previous gunshots, etc. You\\'ll realize you can start to anticipate things before they happen, and you\\'ll be better prepared to handle situations when they occur. Things will start to slow down and you\\'ll be able to reduce the chaos of fighting.Don\\'t stand still very often out in the open. You\\'d be surprised how often someone is scoped in on you waiting for you to stop moving for a headshot. Even if you aren\\'t doing anything, keeping moving in place - forward, backward, and side-to-side in an unpredictable manner.Resist the temptation to shoot people the moment you see them if they haven\\'t spotted you yet unless you have a kill shot lined up. A tiger doesn\\'t attack its prey the moment he spots it. He tries to sneak up into the best position to secure a kill. Often times, people won\\'t see you, and you\\'ll have a better opportunity to guarantee a kill if you\\'re patient. Also, patience doesn\\'t mean passive. You want to be intelligently aggressive.Smoke grenades are undervalued by nearly everyone. You should pretty much always carry at least 4 if you can. They can bail you out of sticky situations and they can be used offensively or defensively. They\\'re often the solution to some very difficult problems.Don\\'t be selfish in team games. If you have been knocked down, it\\'s your duty to make a smart decision for the team about whether you\\'re able to be revived. Also, play near your teammates. You generally want to be in range to \"trade\" with the enemy if you or your teammate gets knocked down.Find weapons that you like and use them as often as you can. Specialization will help you get more repetitions in and will help build your muscle memory faster. I generally prefer a 556 rifle for close range, and a DMR for long-range. If you\\'re newer, I would recommend against using bolt actions for the time being. They\\'re considerably more difficult to use than a Mini or even a M16, and the game is going to be hard enough for you.Have fun.This is what i use:Pro tip #1: Lower magnification scopes and higher mouse sensitivities are a great way to control full auto spraying. I started with Shroud\\'s settings and then tainted them to suit my never-ready-for-e-sports aiming style better: I use: 800 DPI with General: 60, Targeting: 60, Iron-sight Sensitivity: 55, and all the scope sensitivities to 50.Pro tip #2: Bind dedicated keys to different medical items and grenades. At the minimum make sure you can spam bandages, energy drinks, and first-aids.Pro tip #3: Bind the side buttons of your mouse to control pitch of motorcycles. Mine are: Air Control Pitch Up: Thumb Mouse Button Air Control Pitch Down: Thumb Mouse Button 2Pro tip #4: Bind your map and compass marking to your mouse. Mark My Location: Thumb Mouse Button <-- So you can mark your location on map, i.e. if you find loot for your team. Quick Marker: Thumb Mouse Button 2 / Left Mouse Button <-- So when you shoot it will mark the direction on teams compass and you can also mark it manually with a side button.Pro tip #5: Practice with every weapon and grip. What i find is Vert grip on everything except for Mutant and G36c which i think are both better served with an angled grip (they have nasty horizontal drift between shots so if you set your sens right then vert recoil shouldn\\'t be an issue on these).Pro tip #6: Crosshair color. I use a shroud-like cyan, Red: 1, Green: 255, Blue: 255. The Red: 1 is just to get those pixels on for a brighter fuller crosshair. Maybe it doesn\\'t matter or maybe it depends on your monitor.Pro tip #7: Bind autorun. I use Ctrl + Space (Sometimes it leads to me jumping when i spam it. I wish i could just double tap \\'W\\' like Arma 3.)Pro tip #23: With all? weapons the first bullet is always dead on, and then their is a huge jump before the automatic spray settles for about 4 more shots before drifting further, so don\\'t try to 2-round burst guns like the AK. I think WackyJacky recommends 5-round bursts also.Pro tip: #24: Watch WackyJacky videos. They cover every scope, weapon, and general topic you can think of, e.g. how to land fast with parachute.Pro tip: #20d: Backup your settings folder somewhere safe for times when the devs decide to wreck it back to default. The files themselves are located in %localappdata%\\\\TslGame\\\\Saved\\\\Config\\\\WindowsNoEditor\\\\ but i like to just copy the whole %localappdata%\\\\TslGame\\\\ folder to keep everything together.NOTE: Thumb Mouse Button -> the mouse side button closest to you. Thumb Mouse Button 2 -> the mouse side button farthest from you.1 - Pay attention to how you are playing in the moment, don\\'t \"Phase out\" and do what you\\'d normally do.To expand upon this point, imagine you are commentating over your own gameplay. Take note of everything you are doing mentally. Focusing a point to much? Identify that and change accordingly.The worst mistake you can make is trusting yourself to make the right call. You need to be your own voice of doubt. It\\'s better to run away from a fight than to die in one.2 - Pay attention to your surroundings, and get used to identifying positions by sound.One thing I use for training this is the following site ; https://www.pubg8x.com/gunfire?lang=englishYou want to get used to knowing exactly where you are being shot from by sound alone. If you hear a shot whiz past your head, you want to be able to look to where the shot came from and identify high risk points.Broken windows, sides of trees, tops of buildings, anywhere you would want to be if you were the shooter. The first step to winning a fight is finding out where your enemy is, the better you are at this, the better you\\'ll be at Pubg.3 - Risk assessment.You hear a massive gunfight in a compound nearby, what do you do?Take note of your weapons, meds, grenades and assess if you\\'ll actually stand a chance in those fights - No sense going up against a team with crate weapons if you only have a 1911.After you have made this assessment, survey the landscape, are there any elevated positions you can shoot from, or anywhere you can fall back for cover if they notice you? If not, it might be best to leave it alone.4 - Hotkeys.For the love of all that is holy, set hot keys for meds/grenades. Too many times have I died because I have accidentally clicked on the wrong med, or that few seconds that it took me was enough for me to be pushed.The faster you can heal, the faster you can get back into the fight.5 - Leaning.Get used to leaning around corners, or even in head-to-head gunfights.The more your head moves, the less likely that you are to be headshot. Avoiding that much damage will often be what wins you the fight.6 - Looting.Everybody knows a loot goblin. Most only need to look in a mirror to find one.If you hear somebody nearby and you don\\'t have a weapon, don\\'t go for the medkits. Grab a gun and rip them a new one, then go back to looting. Sure that helmet might look tempting, but it won\\'t matter if somebody is lining up a shot on you already.And unless you need to, never loot in the top 10. It\\'s a death sentence.7 - Stances.Did you know that crouching reduces horizontal and vertical recoil equally to the vertical grip? And going prone reduces it more than a fully kitted M4?Crouching should be your go-to stance in firefights, as its recoil reduction comes at a very low cost, that being, slightly reduced movement speed.Going prone is a fine art, as doing it at the wrong time will get you killed, but doing it at the right time will allow you to easily wipe full squads like swatting a fly.The right time to prone is when you have a visual on an enemy/group of enemies that haven\\'t noticed you. Ensure that you have visual on the maximum amount of people (1 in Solo, 2 in Duo, 3-4 in Squads).If you are confident in your abilities, simply prone, line up your shots and rip into them. Provided you were on target, either the entire squad or atleast half of it should be dead. That gives you the oppertunity to push on the survivors, finish off the downed, or retreat and reposition in the ensuing chaos.Never, and I mean never, prone in a direct firefight, you will be dead before you hit the floor.Pay attention to your surroundings and assess what stance is best for you at the time8 - Accepting defeat.You won\\'t win every game. Sometimes there are just too many random factors that you can\\'t take into account. Dying should not be a point of frustration, it should be a point of learning. Take note of how you died, and you won\\'t die to it again in the future.Even the best pro players only have a 25% win rate, that means that the other 75% of the time, they get their ass beat. Accept defeat for what it is and try again, don\\'t get angry, as that will only perpetuate any issues you have when playing. And when you spend too long doing the wrong thing, it makes learning the right thing even harder.'}]\n"

            "[' Welcome guys! In this video, we will be taking a look at the top 20 best weapons in this game.', \" So I tested each and every weapons performance and made this list, and also it's based on my three years of experience in PUBG Mobile.\", ' Anyway, this weapon analysis is based on 2021 January 8th, and PUBG can either nerf or buff the weapons in upcoming updates.', ' So the numbers can change in future but currently, at the number one spot, we have MK14.', ' Surprisingly the MK14 always been on number one spot in my last two videos as well.', ' The main reason why the MK14 is the most powerful weapon in this game is because of its damage.', ' It has a base damage of almost 61, which is the highest in any fully automatic weapons.', ' Anyway, let me explain you how the vests and helmets will give you protection.', ' For example, level one vest and helmets will give you 30% protection, meaning that they will reduce the damage by 30%.', ' Similarly, the level two vest and helmet will give you 40% protection, and the level three will give you 55% protection from the base damage, and MK14 only requires four bullets to take down the opponent.', \" Doesn't matter what type of armor the opponent is using, just four bullets are enough.\", ' Every time I fight against MK14, there is a higher chance of me losing the fight.', ' Sometimes it can shoot without making any sound after first shot.', \" By the way, that's a glitch which is another advantage for that weapon.\", \" Moving on to the MK14's recoil, higher damage comes at the cost of higher recoil.\", ' So MK has the highest damage in any fully automatic weapon, so it will also have the highest recoil in the game.', ' Anyway, MK14 has only two attachment for reducing the recoil, muzzle and stock attachments.', ' For the muzzle, compensator is the best, and for stock, cheat pad its main purpose is for single tapping.', \" Just for comparison, we are comparing MK's recoil next to AKM fully attached to see how it looks.\", ' It looks like the vertical recoil is almost close, but however, the horizontal recoil is way higher.', ' You absolutely need to run MK14 with its full attachments, otherwise your sprays will look like this.', ' But exactly how powerful is MK14? In terms of numbers, it has 668 damage per second, which is the highest in this game.', ' Anyway, there are three situations in time to kill calculations.', ' One where all the bullets hit the upper chest area, and another one where all the bullet hits the headshot, and lastly, one shot is a headshot, and rest all hit the upper chest.', ' And the time to kill calculations are also the lowest, making the MK14 the most powerful weapon in this game.', \" Being the most powerful weapon doesn't mean it doesn't have any downsides, its main disadvantage is that its magazine size, limited to 20 rounds per single spray, this can actually get you killed in some situations like this.\", ' At the number two spot, we have Groza, an air drop exclusive weapon.', ' Groza is the most powerful assault rifle in this entire game specialized for close range fights.', ' Anyway the Groza and AKM have the same base damage, but Groza can shoot 20% faster than the AKM, and 18% faster than the barrel.', ' Here is the damage chart for Groza, and remember AKM and MK47 Mutant also has the same identical damage.', \" Moving on to the Groza's recoil, just for comparison, we are comparing Groza's recoil next to AKM and barrel to see how well it compares next to them.\", ' Surprisingly Groza has the lowest recoil among all the 7.', \"62 assault rifles, and if you want to run this weapon for mid-range, you could do that easily, because Groza's recoil comes really close to the M4.\", \" The best thing about this weapon is that it doesn't require any attachments rather than a suppressor and extended mag.\", \" Anyway, suppressor doesn't affect the recoil that much, so it doesn't matter, but how powerful is Groza exactly? It has a deep PS of approximately 600, and you know what, Groza is the only weapon that can outperform MK14 in terms of time to kill, but only when your opponent is wearing level 1 or level 2 vest and helmets.\", \" So why Groza isn't on number 1 spot because it can outperform MK14 in some situations you might be thinking, well, MK14 is a weapon that is really good at all the ranges like close to mid and long range, while the Groza is specially made for close range, so that is why it's not on number 1 spot.\", ' At the number 3 spot, we have another air drop exclusive only weapon the M249.', \" I'm sure everyone had argued with your teammates about who gets to keep this weapon.\", \" Everyone likes to use this weapon because of its magazine size, which is 100 rounds that's more than enough to wipe out an entire squad without reloading in between.\", ' Everyone will recognize this weapon by its sound, and they will be afraid to take a fight against you, especially because the amount of damage it can do to your opponents.', ' With this weapon, you can easily blow up the vehicles and kill the entire squad instantly.', ' I mean the amount of damage it does, just take a look at the damage chart, it has slightly more damage than the 5.', '56 assault rifles like M4 and others, but the thing is it can shoot 20% faster than them.', \" So let's take a look at the M249's recoil patterns, it feels a bit difficult to spray with M249 at mid range.\", \" And also let's compare it next to M4 and AKM to see how well the M249 performs in terms of recoil.\", \" By looking at this results, the M249 has the low vertical recoil, but however the horizontal recoil, I don't know what to say about that, but it looks really hard to control it, but the first 10 bullets of M249 have low horizontal recoil, so I would suggest if you ever had to spray with M249, try to take down your target in first 10 bullets, otherwise the horizontal recoil is really challenging to control.\", \" Coming at the number 4 spot, we have AWM, the deadliest bolt action sniper rifle in this game, of course its air drop only weapon, so it will have some special skills, for example, it's the only weapon that can one shot kill the opponent with an instant headshot, here is the damage for the AWM it has the overall highest damage in the entire game.\", \" Quickly following up at the number 5 spot, we have the M24, another bolt action sniper rifle, but its main disadvantage is that it's not as powerful as the AWM.\", ' Anyway, here is the damage chart for that weapon, by the way, the M24 does 5% more damage than the car 98K, and if you want to know more about the differences between car 98 and M24 check out my weapon comparison that might help you.', ' So at the number 6 spot, we have car 98K, some people prefer to use this weapon because of its sound, but technically the M24 is a better weapon than the car 98K, and they both have the same thing in common, they both cannot destroy the level 3 helmet in one shot.', \" At the number 7 spot, we have the Uzi, the fastest firing weapon in this game, so let me tell you few best things about this weapon, it has the very low recoil, in fact its lowest in any fully automatic weapon, but the damage is also low, since it can shoot two times faster than most of the weapons, damage isn't a big deal.\", ' Anyway, here is damage for all the vest and helmets, pause the screen and take a closer look to understand how many bullets you need to hit in order to kill the opponent.', \" The main reason why I'm putting Uzi to this list is because of its rate of fire, Uzi can shoot two times faster than most of the other weapons, this makes the Uzi one of the most powerful weapons in close range.\", ' If you play a lot of solos then you must take Uzi, but however, in squads, there is a big disadvantage for Uzi, Uzi can only take down one enemy at a time, if multiple enemies comes at the same time, there is a higher risk of you losing against them, because you are only limited to 25 to 35 rounds which is fine since Uzi can shoot two times faster, you might run out of ammo after killing one enemy, so Uzi is not a weapon that can be used against multiple enemies at the same time.', ' I mean Uzi is so powerful in one versus one fights, you always win with this weapon, but if suddenly another enemy shows up, you might end up dying like this.', \" So how powerful is Uzi exactly? It has a DPS of approximately 540, which is more than average of most of the weapons, and the time to kill results are really good, especially because it's under 0.\", '4 seconds.', \" At the number 8 spot, we have G36C, quickly following up at the number 9 spot, M416, and then at the number 10 spot, Auge 3, the main reason why I'm ranking all these three weapons together is because they are very similar, all the 5.\", '56 assault rifles have the same damage, and also the same rate of fire.', ' Anyway, here is the damage for all the 5.', '56 assault rifles, including Scar L and QBZ.', \" But what makes G36C a better weapon than the M4 and Ogg? Well it's the recoil pattern.\", ' G36C has almost straight lines when we compare it next to M4, G36C may have higher vertical recoil, but it has completely no horizontal recoil, making the G36C a better weapon for spraying from mid to long range.', \" And I also compare it Ogg's recoil next to M4, being an air drop exclusive will have its advantages, so Ogg has better spraying patterns and less recoil than the M4, but not good as G36C.\", ' The reason I put Ogg at number 10 is because it takes one extra second to reload the weapon when we compare it next to M4 and G36C, and that can cause some problems in close range fights.', \" Anyway moving on to the number 11 spot, we have DBS shotgun it's currently the most powerful shotgun in this game, and it was an air drop only weapon few months ago but not anymore.\", ' But the way how a shotgun works is when you fire, it will hit 9 bullets or 9 shells of shotgun bullets, and each bullet will do a certain amount of damage, in case of DBS.', ' Here are the damage chart.', \" Anyway, it's really hard to determine how much damage you do in a single shot, because out of 9 shotgun shells you most likely to miss few, and also here is the damage for vest and helmet, and this totally depends on how many shotgun shells will hit the enemy out of 9.\", ' Shotguns have the ability to one shot kill the opponent instantly in close range fights, and this makes the DBS one of the deadliest weapons to use in extremely close range fights.', ' But if you miss your shot, you will be at a massive disadvantage.', ' Anyway, shotguns are only good in early games, as soon as the players start to get level 3 helmets and vest, shotguns ability to one shot will lose.', \" Shotguns will do less damage against level 3 enemies, so it's not going to be powerful in end game situations.\", \" Quickly following at number 12 spot, we have S12K, another shotgun, but it's a semi-automatic shotgun, S12K has 5% less damage than DBS, 5% isn't a big difference, because S12K can still one shot kill the opponent just like DBS.\", \" Now at the number 13 spot, we have DP28, it's a very popular weapon well known for its high damage output with really low recoil, so the DP28 has almost the same damage of AKM, and here is the rest of the damage information about DP28.\", ' But also while maintaining high damage, it has almost the same recoil as M4, maybe better recoil controlling than the M4.', \" But there are some downsides for this weapon, it sure does have almost the same damage of AKM, but it shoots 10 to 15% slower than an AKM, that's how it was able to achieve that low recoil, but also it's an LMG meaning reloading takes a lot of time, and your movements will be slower and stuff like that.\", ' DP28 is really a great weapon for mid to long range, it has a DPS of approximately 430 which is low, but with low recoil, you can easily take down the enemies from far.', ' At the number 14 spot, we have QBU which replaces mini 14 in Sandhawk, and the amount of damage it can do, surprisingly, it does more damage than an SKS which uses 7.', '62 ammunition, while the QBU uses 5.', '56 ammo.', \" Anyway here is the damage information for QBU, but in other maps, QBU isn't available since it's Sandhawk exclusive only, so mini 14 is actually gonna replace QBU in other maps, but mini doesn't have the same damage stats as QBU, but it does have very low recoil for single tapping.\", ' Coming at the number 15 spot, we have barrel M762 and assault rifle of 7.', '62 ammunition, in my opinion, barrel is a better version of AKM, even though it has 5% less damage than AKM, but it can shoot 15 to 20% faster than AKM depending on your FPS.', ' Here is the full damage information for barrel, but the best thing about barrel is that if you put all the right attachments, it will have better recoil controlling the AKM, as well as the barrel gives you some customization with grips.', ' This is the main reason, why barrel is on top of AKM.', ' Anyway moving on to the number 16 spot, we have Tommy Gunn, or Thompson depending on what you call it.', \" It's an SMG with really high damage of 42 a bit higher than 5.\", '56 assault rifles, and here is the rest of the damage information, by the way, it takes only four bullets to kill your opponent if you shoot your opponent in either arms or legs.', \" So that is quite interesting about this weapon, and always remember arms and legs doesn't get protected by helmet and vest.\", \" The downsides for Tommy Gunn are, you can only use red dot or holo sight scopes, but it's not a big problem, since it's an SMG, SMGs are not good in the mid to long range, because your bullets won't hit the targets due to the low bullet velocity.\", \" And the recoil of Tommy Gunn is very high, almost close to the M4, but it's okay since it has almost the same damage as an M4.\", ' And now to the number 17 spot, we have the vector, yes another SMG.', ' The main reason why I put this weapon is because the vector is an overpowered weapon in 90 FPS, it outperforms any other SMG, and here is the damage info for this weapon.', \" Now at the number 18 spot, we have desert eagle, it's a pistol, but not just any ordinary pistol, it has really high damage of almost 62, it can take down your opponent in less than four shots, doesn't matter what type of helmet and vest your opponent is using, it just destroys.\", ' Here is the damage information, so you will better understand how powerful is this pistol exactly.', \" By the way it does more damage than MK14, at the number 19 spot, we have the AKM, it's still one of the most powerful weapons because of its damage, and here is the full damage information about AKM.\", \" I mean the AKM is a great weapon to use in early games, it doesn't require as many attachments as barrel.\", \" Everyone likes the AKM iron site, it's the best iron site in this game.\", ' Now to the number 20 spot, finally we have the Scar L, a 5.', \"56 assault rifle, Scar L and M4 are very similar weapons, they both share same damage and the same rate of fire, so the stats will be very similar, but the problem with the Scar L is that it's recoil, it has very unpredictable horizontal recoil, in close range, it doesn't matter since it's easy to control recoil, but for spraying in mid to long range, you will definitely feel the difficulty in controlling recoil.\", \" Anyway, that's all for this video, I hope you learned something new, if you did hit the like button and subscribe for more upcoming videos like this, see you

            "NEW DATA =  Welcome guys! In this video, we will be taking a look at the top 20 best weapons in this game. So I tested each and every weapons performance and made this list, and also it's based on my three years of experience in PUBG Mobile. Anyway, this weapon analysis is based on 2021 January 8th, and PUBG can either nerf or buff the weapons in upcoming updates. So the numbers can change in future but currently, at the number one spot, we have MK14. Surprisingly the MK14 always been on number one spot in my last two videos as well. The main reason why the MK14 is the most powerful weapon in this game is because of its damage. It has a base damage of almost 61, which is the highest in any fully automatic weapons. Anyway, let me explain you how the vests and helmets will give you protection. For example, level one vest and helmets will give you 30% protection, meaning that they will reduce the damage by 30%. Similarly, the level two vest and helmet will give you 40% protection, and the level three will give you 55% protection from the base damage, and MK14 only requires four bullets to take down the opponent. Doesn't matter what type of armor the opponent is using, just four bullets are enough. Every time I fight against MK14, there is a higher chance of me losing the fight. Sometimes it can shoot without making any sound after first shot. By the way, that's a glitch which is another advantage for that weapon. Moving on to the MK14's recoil, higher damage comes at the cost of higher recoil. So MK has the highest damage in any fully automatic weapon, so it will also have the highest recoil in the game. Anyway, MK14 has only two attachment for reducing the recoil, muzzle and stock attachments. For the muzzle, compensator is the best, and for stock, cheat pad its main purpose is for single tapping. Just for comparison, we are comparing MK's recoil next to AKM fully attached to see how it looks. It looks like the vertical recoil is almost close, but however, the horizontal recoil is way higher. You absolutely need to run MK14 with its full attachments, otherwise your sprays will look like this. But exactly how powerful is MK14? In terms of numbers, it has 668 damage per second, which is the highest in this game. Anyway, there are three situations in time to kill calculations. One where all the bullets hit the upper chest area, and another one where all the bullet hits the headshot, and lastly, one shot is a headshot, and rest all hit the upper chest. And the time to kill calculations are also the lowest, making the MK14 the most powerful weapon in this game. Being the most powerful weapon doesn't mean it doesn't have any downsides, its main disadvantage is that its magazine size, limited to 20 rounds per single spray, this can actually get you killed in some situations like this. At the number two spot, we have Groza, an air drop exclusive weapon. Groza is the most powerful assault rifle in this entire game specialized for close range fights. Anyway the Groza and AKM have the same base damage, but Groza can shoot 20% faster than the AKM, and 18% faster than the barrel. Here is the damage chart for Groza, and remember AKM and MK47 Mutant also has the same identical damage. Moving on to the Groza's recoil, just for comparison, we are comparing Groza's recoil next to AKM and barrel to see how well it compares next to them. Surprisingly Groza has the lowest recoil among all the 7.62 assault rifles, and if you want to run this weapon for mid-range, you could do that easily, because Groza's recoil comes really close to the M4. The best thing about this weapon is that it doesn't require any attachments rather than a suppressor and extended mag. Anyway, suppressor doesn't affect the recoil that much, so it doesn't matter, but how powerful is Groza exactly? It has a deep PS of approximately 600, and you know what, Groza is the only weapon that can outperform MK14 in terms of time to kill, but only when your opponent is wearing level 1 or level 2 vest and helmets. So why Groza isn't on number 1 spot because it can outperform MK14 in some situations you might be thinking, well, MK14 is a weapon that is really good at all the ranges like close to mid and long range, while the Groza is specially made for close range, so that is why it's not on number 1 spot. At the number 3 spot, we have another air drop exclusive only weapon the M249. I'm sure everyone had argued with your teammates about who gets to keep this weapon. Everyone likes to use this weapon because of its magazine size, which is 100 rounds that's more than enough to wipe out an entire squad without reloading in between. Everyone will recognize this weapon by its sound, and they will be afraid to take a fight against you, especially because the amount of damage it can do to your opponents. With this weapon, you can easily blow up the vehicles and kill the entire squad instantly. I mean the amount of damage it does, just take a look at the damage chart, it has slightly more damage than the 5.56 assault rifles like M4 and others, but the thing is it can shoot 20% faster than them. So let's take a look at the M249's recoil patterns, it feels a bit difficult to spray with M249 at mid range. And also let's compare it next to M4 and AKM to see how well the M249 performs in terms of recoil. By looking at this results, the M249 has the low vertical recoil, but however the horizontal recoil, I don't know what to say about that, but it looks really hard to control it, but the first 10 bullets of M249 have low horizontal recoil, so I would suggest if you ever had to spray with M249, try to take down your target in first 10 bullets, otherwise the horizontal recoil is really challenging to control. Coming at the number 4 spot, we have AWM, the deadliest bolt action sniper rifle in this game, of course its air drop only weapon, so it will have some special skills, for example, it's the only weapon that can one shot kill the opponent with an instant headshot, here is the damage for the AWM it has the overall highest damage in the entire game. Quickly following up at the number 5 spot, we have the M24, another bolt action sniper rifle, but its main disadvantage is that it's not as powerful as the AWM. Anyway, here is the damage chart for that weapon, by the way, the M24 does 5% more damage than the car 98K, and if you want to know more about the differences between car 98 and M24 check out my weapon comparison that might help you. So at the number 6 spot, we have car 98K, some people prefer to use this weapon because of its sound, but technically the M24 is a better weapon than the car 98K, and they both have the same thing in common, they both cannot destroy the level 3 helmet in one shot. At the number 7 spot, we have the Uzi, the fastest firing weapon in this game, so let me tell you few best things about this weapon, it has the very low recoil, in fact its lowest in any fully automatic weapon, but the damage is also low, since it can shoot two times faster than most of the weapons, damage isn't a big deal. Anyway, here is damage for all the vest and helmets, pause the screen and take a closer look to understand how many bullets you need to hit in order to kill the opponent. The main reason why I'm putting Uzi to this list is because of its rate of fire, Uzi can shoot two times faster than most of the other weapons, this makes the Uzi one of the most powerful weapons in close range. If you play a lot of solos then you must take Uzi, but however, in squads, there is a big disadvantage for Uzi, Uzi can only take down one enemy at a time, if multiple enemies comes at the same time, there is a higher risk of you losing against them, because you are only limited to 25 to 35 rounds which is fine since Uzi can shoot two times faster, you might run out of ammo after killing one enemy, so Uzi is not a weapon that can be used against multiple enemies at the same time. I mean Uzi is so powerful in one versus one fights, you always win with this weapon, but if suddenly another enemy shows up, you might end up dying like this. So how powerful is Uzi exactly? It has a DPS of approximately 540, which is more than average of most of the weapons, and the time to kill results are really good, especially because it's under 0.4 seconds. At the number 8 spot, we have G36C, quickly following up at the number 9 spot, M416, and then at the number 10 spot, Auge 3, the main reason why I'm ranking all these three weapons together is because they are very similar, all the 5.56 assault rifles have the same damage, and also the same rate of fire. Anyway, here is the damage for all the 5.56 assault rifles, including Scar L and QBZ. But what makes G36C a better weapon than the M4 and Ogg? Well it's the recoil pattern. G36C has almost straight lines when we compare it next to M4, G36C may have higher vertical recoil, but it has completely no horizontal recoil, making the G36C a better weapon for spraying from mid to long range.\n"

            "REM DATA =  And I also compare it Ogg's recoil next to M4, being an air drop exclusive will have its advantages, so Ogg has better spraying patterns and less recoil than the M4, but not good as G36C. The reason I put Ogg at number 10 is because it takes one extra second to reload the weapon when we compare it next to M4 and G36C, and that can cause some problems in close range fights. Anyway moving on to the number 11 spot, we have DBS shotgun it's currently the most powerful shotgun in this game, and it was an air drop only weapon few months ago but not anymore. But the way how a shotgun works is when you fire, it will hit 9 bullets or 9 shells of shotgun bullets, and each bullet will do a certain amount of damage, in case of DBS. Here are the damage chart. Anyway, it's really hard to determine how much damage you do in a single shot, because out of 9 shotgun shells you most likely to miss few, and also here is the damage for vest and helmet, and this totally depends on how many shotgun shells will hit the enemy out of 9. Shotguns have the ability to one shot kill the opponent instantly in close range fights, and this makes the DBS one of the deadliest weapons to use in extremely close range fights. But if you miss your shot, you will be at a massive disadvantage. Anyway, shotguns are only good in early games, as soon as the players start to get level 3 helmets and vest, shotguns ability to one shot will lose. Shotguns will do less damage against level 3 enemies, so it's not going to be powerful in end game situations. Quickly following at number 12 spot, we have S12K, another shotgun, but it's a semi-automatic shotgun, S12K has 5% less damage than DBS, 5% isn't a big difference, because S12K can still one shot kill the opponent just like DBS. Now at the number 13 spot, we have DP28, it's a very popular weapon well known for its high damage output with really low recoil, so the DP28 has almost the same damage of AKM, and here is the rest of the damage information about DP28. But also while maintaining high damage, it has almost the same recoil as M4, maybe better recoil controlling than the M4. But there are some downsides for this weapon, it sure does have almost the same damage of AKM, but it shoots 10 to 15% slower than an AKM, that's how it was able to achieve that low recoil, but also it's an LMG meaning reloading takes a lot of time, and your movements will be slower and stuff like that. DP28 is really a great weapon for mid to long range, it has a DPS of approximately 430 which is low, but with low recoil, you can easily take down the enemies from far. At the number 14 spot, we have QBU which replaces mini 14 in Sandhawk, and the amount of damage it can do, surprisingly, it does more damage than an SKS which uses 7.62 ammunition, while the QBU uses 5.56 ammo. Anyway here is the damage information for QBU, but in other maps, QBU isn't available since it's Sandhawk exclusive only, so mini 14 is actually gonna replace QBU in other maps, but mini doesn't have the same damage stats as QBU, but it does have very low recoil for single tapping. Coming at the number 15 spot, we have barrel M762 and assault rifle of 7.62 ammunition, in my opinion, barrel is a better version of AKM, even though it has 5% less damage than AKM, but it can shoot 15 to 20% faster than AKM depending on your FPS. Here is the full damage information for barrel, but the best thing about barrel is that if you put all the right attachments, it will have better recoil controlling the AKM, as well as the barrel gives you some customization with grips. This is the main reason, why barrel is on top of AKM. Anyway moving on to the number 16 spot, we have Tommy Gunn, or Thompson depending on what you call it. It's an SMG with really high damage of 42 a bit higher than 5.56 assault rifles, and here is the rest of the damage information, by the way, it takes only four bullets to kill your opponent if you shoot your opponent in either arms or legs. So that is quite interesting about this weapon, and always remember arms and legs doesn't get protected by helmet and vest. The downsides for Tommy Gunn are, you can only use red dot or holo sight scopes, but it's not a big problem, since it's an SMG, SMGs are not good in the mid to long range, because your bullets won't hit the targets due to the low bullet velocity. And the recoil of Tommy Gunn is very high, almost close to the M4, but it's okay since it has almost the same damage as an M4. And now to the number 17 spot, we have the vector, yes another SMG. The main reason why I put this weapon is because the vector is an overpowered weapon in 90 FPS, it outperforms any other SMG, and here is the damage info for this weapon. Now at the number 18 spot, we have desert eagle, it's a pistol, but not just any ordinary pistol, it has really high damage of almost 62, it can take down your opponent in less than four shots, doesn't matter what type of helmet and vest your opponent is using, it just destroys. Here is the damage information, so you will better understand how powerful is this pistol exactly. By the way it does more damage than MK14, at the number 19 spot, we have the AKM, it's still one of the most powerful weapons because of its damage, and here is the full damage information about AKM. I mean the AKM is a great weapon to use in early games, it doesn't require as many attachments as barrel. Everyone likes the AKM iron site, it's the best iron site in this game. Now to the number 20 spot, finally we have the Scar L, a 5.56 assault rifle, Scar L and M4 are very similar weapons, they both share same damage and the same rate of fire, so the stats will be very similar, but the problem with the Scar L is that it's recoil, it has very unpredictable horizontal recoil, in close range, it doesn't matter since it's easy to control recoil, but for spraying in mid to long range, you will definitely feel the difficulty in controlling recoil. Anyway, that's all for this video, I hope you learned something new, if you did hit the like button and subscribe for more upcoming videos like this, see you guys in the next video.\n"

            "[\" Welcome guys, this is one of the most anticipated video I ever got whether the iPhone is better or the Android In this video, I'll be comparing iPhone versus Android and we'll be going through the following tests as shown in the screen But for this comparison we'll be using an iPhone 11 2019's flagship versus the OnePlus 9 Pro 2021's flagship here are the specs for the device iPhone 11 has four gigs of RAM while the one plus has 12 gigs of RAM That's three times more and not just that the processor is also better in most scenarios But not by a lot and the iPhone is almost two years old But I'm pretty sure it can still compete against latest flagships because iPhones are very well optimized as compared to Android Let me show you what is optimization by opening the PUBG in both phones at the same time So we'll see which one loads up the game faster by looking at the specs of the devices The OnePlus has better performance so it should load up the game faster and it does complete the loading screen faster in the beginning But as the Android gets closer it's getting slower whereas the iPhone catches up and it even loads up significantly faster than Android.\", \" The Android took four seconds longer to load up the game But loading into the lobby screen doesn't matter to most of you So let's check which one will enter into a game faster I will be entering into a cheer park training area which actually takes quite a long time to enter But let's check whether the iPhone will load up faster or the Android So after about ten seconds the iPhone loaded up the game first while the Android is still loading A few moments later Still loading One eternity later So after about 25 seconds the Android finally loaded the game and this is just 2019's iPhone.\", \" Latest iPhones will make even bigger difference for example here I have the latest 2021's iPad Pro And it entered into the game within three seconds that's crazy fast While the Android took about 30 seconds to enter into the game So now I hope you understand how good is iPhones optimization Anyway now let's move on to the gyroscope comparison I have played on both iPhone and Android and when using gyroscope I noticed few things The iPhone gyroscope is more responsive or in other words it feels faster as compared to the Android But I actually wanted to show you exactly so I tried to measure or compare iPhones gyro with Android By stacking up both phones on a tripod but it didn't work At the end I found another way to show you the difference So here I have both phones crosshair pointed towards the same thing And I slowly started tilting both phones at the same time I paused the clip here and you can see that iPhones crosshair is slightly higher than Android That's because iPhones gyro is more responsive and it moves faster and quickly Here is another example right now the gyroscope is going downwards And if you look at Android screen it's slightly behind or slower next to the iPhones screen You can also pause the video to check the difference So the iPhones crosshair will reach to the tower first and then later Android's crosshair will reach to the tower So the Android gyro is slightly behind or delayed when compared next to an iPhone But the gyro delay isn't as big as you would notice in Oppo Vivo devices I would guess that iPhones gyro is approximately 10 to 20 milliseconds faster It could be more but I'm assuming it to be around 10 milliseconds Which is really really small difference barely noticeable to many people And another thing that I have notices that iPhones gyro will sink much faster What I mean by that for example when you sit in a chair and play with gyro The gyro will work just fine on both Android and iPhone But when you lay down in bed and play with gyro And Android it sometimes moves in opposite direction or takes some time To sink to your position whereas in iPhones The gyro will work just fine maybe sometimes it rarely happens So overall the iPhones gives a better gyroscope experience Moving on to the next topic, bullet registration Most people say iPhones bullet will register first So I tested this by shooting at almost the same time in the both phones And I ran this test for more than 20 times And the results were the iPhone winning most of the time So is it really true that iPhones bullets will register first? I mean it could be, it's really hard to test that Since iPhones are very well optimized maybe that's why they register faster But the bullet registration totally depends on your internet connection So I have no idea what to say here But there could be another reason And that is the touch registration Here is a fun thing to know iPhone 11 has 120Hz of touch sampling rate While the OnePlus 9 Pro has 240Hz to 360Hz touch sampling rate That's more than twice So technically OnePlus should register the touch first But in reality the iPhone with its slower touch sampling rate will register the touch first Suppose if you touch the fire button on both the OnePlus and iPhone at the same timing The iPhone will fire first Even though the OnePlus's hardware is capable of being two times faster It's not fully utilizing its true power Or simply in other words Android is not optimized Even if they want to optimize it would be extremely hard Because there are more than 1000 phones to be optimized Whereas on iOS there are only few phones And also every phone has a different specification For example ROG5 has 300Hz touch sampling rate And the Red Magic 6 has a 500Hz touch sampling rate And Lenovo Legion 2 Pro has 720Hz touch sampling rate And every phone has a different touch sampling rate So the game developers can't optimize each and every phone Because they can't even fix the bugs and glitches immediately So just like how iPhone's gyroscope is fast and more responsive In the same way the iPhone's touch is more responsive And faster than Android Anyway moving on to the next topic Will iPhones have less recoil than Android? Not really when comparing both recoil patterns from Android And iPhones side by side they look identical Here is the hipfire recoil comparison between Android and iPhone And the hipfire spread will be identical between Android and iPhone I mean the hipfire spread will be totally random every time But it looks identical in terms of recoil But why do people say iPhone has less recoil? Well there is only one explanation I have for that iPhones gyro and touch are very responsive Because of that it feels controlling recoil is easier on iPhone When compared to an Android phone Moving on to the next topic Amosist does iPhones have better Amosist? Well let's find out So here is the side by side comparison of Android and iPhones Amosist And the Amosist is identical in both It performs in the same way between Android and iPhone But why do people say Amosist works better on iPhone? Most people just think that If iPhone is better at few things Then it will be better with other things as well But in reality iPhone has only one advantage and that is optimization And maybe the other reason could be a smoother experience What I mean by that is iPhones will get constant 60 FPS Whereas on Android you do get 60 FPS But it's not stable it always fluctuates and drops a lot of frames And you will notice those frame drops and it's very annoying And it can affect your gaming experience iPhones will provide you with buttery smooth gaming experience So this could be a reason why the people think Amosist and controlling recoil is better in iPhones The only advantage I think Android has over iPhones is that 90 FPS But only few phones will support it And currently the OnePlus 9 Pro doesn't have support to 90 FPS So I have no idea what it's like to play in 90 FPS on Android But as far as I know Most of the player say Android 90 FPS feels like iPhone 60 FPS in terms of smoothness of gameplay But however upcoming iPhones will get 90 FPS option Soon the Android will lose its the only advantage Because Android 90 FPS vs iPhone 90 FPS Is literally like Android 60 FPS vs iPhone 60 FPS So as you know that iPhone will obviously get a constant and stable 90 FPS Whereas the Android always fluctuates between 90 to 50 FPS And now to the graphics comparison So here we have side by side comparison of graphics We have set the same graphics settings on both devices HDR extreme and colorful graphics So now you watch it and find out if there is any differences And let me know in the comments And now if you see the sun's reflection on vehicle doors The iPhone looks really good whereas on Android it looks kind of bad The textures aren't that good as you see on iPhone This could be a screen recording issue or maybe the graphics issues So the graphics looks identical to me But however if you look closer you would notice that iPhone renders houses slightly faster than Android It's like 50 to 100 milliseconds faster on iPhones But both has the same rendering distance and that is around 300 meters So in the final conclusion the iPhones are better than Android when it comes to gaming Especially on PUBG mobile iPhone has better touch response and better gyroscope sensors to get accurate sprays And most importantly stable and constant 60 FPS Which makes your gaming experience buttery smooth However iPhones are very expensive but you're paying for what you're getting Android would last only 2 to 3 years where the iPhones can last up to 6 years If you don't break it an Apple will provide software updates for more than 6 years And it gives you a better experience for everything overall But Android phones are affordable you can get it in any price range Where in iPhones you don't get that choice Anyway that's all I got for this video I hope you learned something new If you did hit the like button and subscribe for more upcoming videos like this And see you guys in the next video enjoy my bot gameplay I am a monster I just need to get it men I need to need.\", ' The thing that I just painted out.', \" when we won't go see See my vision I've been unit I'm a killer I'm a fuckin doll Come in there I'ma play it now I'm a turd dog I'ma play the book I gotta go and get it man, I really just need it Tell these guys they can beat it I'ma get it, I'ma grab it man You never see that, I'ma make it mine I'm explosive like a mine I've been working every time Yeah, I do it on the grind, I'm a shy I'm a shy, yeah I'm be single today I'm a coldest competition Cause some goiss-hoes say Hey, I really go bustin' what's saying Yeah, I guess really ran through the pain But I'm just back at my path And I fixed it now, it's really okay So I ain't gonna waste And my chance to do my time So I'ma be a massive I'ma killin' this is my end, yeah I'm a dumbass Yeah, I am ready to fire I got a million, the sirens They just need to go achieve I just need to acquire So if I've been climbing up this ladder Yeah, some going up higher I need to do it till the day I'm a retire.\"]\n"

            "REM DATA =  Welcome guys, this is one of the most anticipated video I ever got whether the iPhone is better or the Android In this video, I'll be comparing iPhone versus Android and we'll be going through the following tests as shown in the screen But for this comparison we'll be using an iPhone 11 2019's flagship versus the OnePlus 9 Pro 2021's flagship here are the specs for the device iPhone 11 has four gigs of RAM while the one plus has 12 gigs of RAM That's three times more and not just that the processor is also better in most scenarios But not by a lot and the iPhone is almost two years old But I'm pretty sure it can still compete against latest flagships because iPhones are very well optimized as compared to Android Let me show you what is optimization by opening the PUBG in both phones at the same time So we'll see which one loads up the game faster by looking at the specs of the devices The OnePlus has better performance so it should load up the game faster and it does complete the loading screen faster in the beginning But as the Android gets closer it's getting slower whereas the iPhone catches up and it even loads up significantly faster than Android. The Android took four seconds longer to load up the game But loading into the lobby screen doesn't matter to most of you So let's check which one will enter into a game faster I will be entering into a cheer park training area which actually takes quite a long time to enter But let's check whether the iPhone will load up faster or the Android So after about ten seconds the iPhone loaded up the game first while the Android is still loading A few moments later Still loading One eternity later So after about 25 seconds the Android finally loaded the game and this is just 2019's iPhone. Latest iPhones will make even bigger difference for example here I have the latest 2021's iPad Pro And it entered into the game within three seconds that's crazy fast While the Android took about 30 seconds to enter into the game So now I hope you understand how good is iPhones optimization Anyway now let's move on to the gyroscope comparison I have played on both iPhone and Android and when using gyroscope I noticed few things The iPhone gyroscope is more responsive or in other words it feels faster as compared to the Android But I actually wanted to show you exactly so I tried to measure or compare iPhones gyro with Android By stacking up both phones on a tripod but it didn't work At the end I found another way to show you the difference So here I have both phones crosshair pointed towards the same thing And I slowly started tilting both phones at the same time I paused the clip here and you can see that iPhones crosshair is slightly higher than Android That's because iPhones gyro is more responsive and it moves faster and quickly Here is another example right now the gyroscope is going downwards And if you look at Android screen it's slightly behind or slower next to the iPhones screen You can also pause the video to check the difference So the iPhones crosshair will reach to the tower first and then later Android's crosshair will reach to the tower So the Android gyro is slightly behind or delayed when compared next to an iPhone But the gyro delay isn't as big as you would notice in Oppo Vivo devices I would guess that iPhones gyro is approximately 10 to 20 milliseconds faster It could be more but I'm assuming it to be around 10 milliseconds Which is really really small difference barely noticeable to many people And another thing that I have notices that iPhones gyro will sink much faster What I mean by that for example when you sit in a chair and play with gyro The gyro will work just fine on both Android and iPhone But when you lay down in bed and play with gyro And Android it sometimes moves in opposite direction or takes some time To sink to your position whereas in iPhones The gyro will work just fine maybe sometimes it rarely happens So overall the iPhones gives a better gyroscope experience Moving on to the next topic, bullet registration Most people say iPhones bullet will register first So I tested this by shooting at almost the same time in the both phones And I ran this test for more than 20 times And the results were the iPhone winning most of the time So is it really true that iPhones bullets will register first? I mean it could be, it's really hard to test that Since iPhones are very well optimized maybe that's why they register faster But the bullet registration totally depends on your internet connection So I have no idea what to say here But there could be another reason And that is the touch registration Here is a fun thing to know iPhone 11 has 120Hz of touch sampling rate While the OnePlus 9 Pro has 240Hz to 360Hz touch sampling rate That's more than twice So technically OnePlus should register the touch first But in reality the iPhone with its slower touch sampling rate will register the touch first Suppose if you touch the fire button on both the OnePlus and iPhone at the same timing The iPhone will fire first Even though the OnePlus's hardware is capable of being two times faster It's not fully utilizing its true power Or simply in other words Android is not optimized Even if they want to optimize it would be extremely hard Because there are more than 1000 phones to be optimized Whereas on iOS there are only few phones And also every phone has a different specification For example ROG5 has 300Hz touch sampling rate And the Red Magic 6 has a 500Hz touch sampling rate And Lenovo Legion 2 Pro has 720Hz touch sampling rate And every phone has a different touch sampling rate So the game developers can't optimize each and every phone Because they can't even fix the bugs and glitches immediately So just like how iPhone's gyroscope is fast and more responsive In the same way the iPhone's touch is more responsive And faster than Android Anyway moving on to the next topic Will iPhones have less recoil than Android? Not really when comparing both recoil patterns from Android And iPhones side by side they look identical Here is the hipfire recoil comparison between Android and iPhone And the hipfire spread will be identical between Android and iPhone I mean the hipfire spread will be totally random every time But it looks identical in terms of recoil But why do people say iPhone has less recoil? Well there is only one explanation I have for that iPhones gyro and touch are very responsive Because of that it feels controlling recoil is easier on iPhone When compared to an Android phone Moving on to the next topic Amosist does iPhones have better Amosist? Well let's find out So here is the side by side comparison of Android and iPhones Amosist And the Amosist is identical in both It performs in the same way between Android and iPhone But why do people say Amosist works better on iPhone? Most people just think that If iPhone is better at few things Then it will be better with other things as well But in reality iPhone has only one advantage and that is optimization And maybe the other reason could be a smoother experience What I mean by that is iPhones will get constant 60 FPS Whereas on Android you do get 60 FPS But it's not stable it always fluctuates and drops a lot of frames And you will notice those frame drops and it's very annoying And it can affect your gaming experience iPhones will provide you with buttery smooth gaming experience So this could be a reason why the people think Amosist and controlling recoil is better in iPhones The only advantage I think Android has over iPhones is that 90 FPS But only few phones will support it And currently the OnePlus 9 Pro doesn't have support to 90 FPS So I have no idea what it's like to play in 90 FPS on Android But as far as I know Most of the player say Android 90 FPS feels like iPhone 60 FPS in terms of smoothness of gameplay But however upcoming iPhones will get 90 FPS option Soon the Android will lose its the only advantage Because Android 90 FPS vs iPhone 90 FPS Is literally like Android 60 FPS vs iPhone 60 FPS So as you know that iPhone will obviously get a constant and stable 90 FPS Whereas the Android always fluctuates between 90 to 50 FPS And now to the graphics comparison So here we have side by side comparison of graphics We have set the same graphics settings on both devices HDR extreme and colorful graphics So now you watch it and find out if there is any differences And let me know in the comments And now if you see the sun's reflection on vehicle doors The iPhone looks really good whereas on Android it looks kind of bad The textures aren't that good as you see on iPhone This could be a screen recording issue or maybe the graphics issues So the graphics looks identical to me But however if you look closer you would notice that iPhone renders houses slightly faster than Android It's like 50 to 100 milliseconds faster on iPhones But both has the same rendering distance and that is around 300 meters So in the final conclusion the iPhones are better than Android when it comes to gaming Especially on PUBG mobile iPhone has better touch response and better gyroscope sensors to get accurate sprays And most importantly stable and constant 60 FPS Which makes your gaming experience buttery smooth However iPhones are very expensive but you're paying for what you're getting Android would last only 2 to 3 years where the iPhones can last up to 6 years If you don't break it an Apple will provide software updates for more than 6 years And it gives you a better experience for everything overall But Android phones are affordable you can get it in any price range Where in iPhones you don't get that choice Anyway that's all I got for this video I hope you learned something new If you did hit the like button and subscribe for more upcoming videos like this And see you guys in the next video enjoy my bot gameplay I am a monster I just need to get it men I need to need. The thing that I just painted out. when we won't go see See my vision I've been unit I'm a killer I'm a fuckin doll Come in there I'ma play it now I'm a turd dog I'ma play the book I gotta go and get it man, I really just need it Tell these guys they can beat it I'ma get it, I'ma grab it man You never see that, I'ma make it mine I'm explosive like a mine I've been working every time Yeah, I do it on the grind, I'm a shy I'm a shy, yeah I'm be single today I'm a coldest competition Cause some goiss-hoes say Hey, I really go bustin' what's saying Yeah, I guess really ran through the pain But I'm just back at my path And I fixed it now, it's really okay So I ain't gonna waste And my chance to do my time So I'ma be a massive I'ma killin' this is my end, yeah I'm a dumbass Yeah, I am ready to fire I got a million, the sirens They just need to go achieve I just need to acquire So if I've been climbing up this ladder Yeah, some going up higher I need to do it till the day I'm a retire.\n"

            "NOT MORE THAN 2048 TOKEN : DATA  Welcome guys, in this video, we will be taking a look at the one of the most controversial topic, and that is iPad vs iPhones. Many people say that iPads have a lot of unfair advantages against iPhone players, or basically any mobile players, so is it really true, let's find out. So starting with the first obvious and noticeable difference is the screen size, the iPad has bigger display, which means spotting enemies will be easier, since all the objects will appear bigger on the iPad, but not just that, the iPad will give you some extra viewing angle, that you normally won't get it on phones, which also known as iPad view. If you're wondering exactly how much extra view do you get with an iPad, for example this is iPhone 11 view, and now this is the iPad view. So now you can see it yourself on how much extra you can view with an iPad, and by the way, this is iPad Pro 11 inch model, other iPads may have even more extra view, or lesser view, but however with any iPad you obviously get the iPad view, which gives around 40 to 50% extra view. In my opinion I think the bottom view is least useful, but sometimes it can be useful in some situations. I've been playing on iPad for the past 20 days, and the top view was most useful for me, it can help you in a Ridge Fight situation. iPad extra view will allow you to see your enemy, before they see you, and having an extra viewing angle is always a better thing, sometimes you might get lucky with iPad's view. But most importantly in final circles, if you lay down, the extra view will be a huge advantage in this situation to spot other players in the grass. So what do you think, is this an unfair advantage against mobile players? Let me know in the comments, and in my opinion yes this is unfair, but actually no it's just an advantage, because iPads got a bigger display, and if they don't utilize that extra space on the screen, you'd get black bars like this. So this is why I call this as an advantage, so is it unfair, yes but actually no, but you also have to remember that extra view will require more rendering, and more processing power. In order to display that iPad view, since iPads are usually more powerful than mobile phones they can do that, moving on to the next thing, which is hipfire, many people say that iPads hipfire is crazy accurate, and that is true. As I said before, I started using iPads since last 20 days and I can feel that hipfire is so powerful in iPad, normally if the enemy is at 30 meters, or above I'd open the scope and fire, but with iPad I don't really need to open scope and fire, because hip firing is so reliable and powerful, and this is a huge advantage in close combat fights. Here is an example, the enemy is around 30 meters away or more, and you can clearly see how accurately I was able to knock with hipfire at this distance, normally in mobile phones, you wouldn't be able to do this with hipfire. So yeah, iPads have another unfair advantage in close range with this crazy accurate hipfire. Moving on to the recoil controlling, most people would say that iPads have less recoil, and you can spray easily at long distance. So is this really true, let's find that out, so I tested the iPads recoil and iPhones recoil pattern, and adjusted their sizes according to the aspect ratio, and compared them side by side, and they look identical, or very similar, but you might be thinking why iPads recoil goes left and right more often. Well, the recoil patterns or spray patterns are totally random, sometimes you get unlucky, and the recoil goes either left or right. It also happens on iPhone or any device, not just on iPad. So I did another test, but this time I compared the gap between each and every bullet, or the distance between each bullet, and compare it against the other one, and I did this few times. Sometimes iPhone gets lower value, sometimes iPad gets lower value, but they are very close, so I think the recoil is very identical, or basically the same random patterns. So why do people say it's easier to control recoil on iPad? Well, it's actually easier to control recoil on iPad because, on mobile phones, you get a smaller screen, which means you have less space for your fingers to move around, whereas on iPad you get, so much space to work around, because it has a bigger display. Bigger display means you can drag down your finger easily without any problems, and that's why it looks and feels like iPad has less recoil, but in reality all the devices will most likely to have the same recoil system. But on mobile phones you don't get that bigger area to control recoil as you would on iPad. So this is the reason why most people say iPad has less recoil. Moving on to the next one, which is Amocyst, so here is the Amocyst side-by-side comparison, between iPad vs iPhone. Anyway, the iPad was able to hit the enemy first, while the cross-hairer aim is at same level as the iPhone. So this means iPad has better Amocyst? I mean yes, but I can't be 100% sure that iPad has better Amocyst, however the reason why the iPad's hipfire is accurate is maybe because of the better Amocyst. So what do you think? Does iPad really have better Amocyst? So in the final conclusion, iPads has a lot of advantages against mobile players, most of them are unfair. But if you're thinking of buying an iPad to play professionally in tournaments, then let me tell you that iPads are not allowed on official PUBG mobile tournaments because of those iPad advantages, which would be really unfair for other players without an iPad. However if you want to play this game just for fun, or rank pushing, then maybe playing on a iPad would be okay, but most people would say it's unfair, and I totally agree with that. But iPad players cannot get a separate lobby like emulator players, because there are only 1-2% of iPad players, and if they get separate lobby, it would be filled with just bots, since there are not many players. So iPad players will most likely play in mobile player lobby, but however if PUBG could remove some unfair advantage like that hipfire accuracy and better Amocyst, then maybe it would be okay I guess, so what do you think? And also you can get iPad for really low price, while giving you same or better performance as an iPhone XS Max, you would get stable 60 FPS without any frame drops, there are also other models with different price range. And if you want to play on iPad will give you a better gaming experience than mobile phones, and there will be always one guy with an iPad in your friend list, who would most likely steal all your kills because of the iPad unfair advantages, and it gives overall a better gaming experience with stable 60 FPS. Anyway, that's all I got for this video, I hope you learned something new, if you did hit the like button, and subscribe for more upcoming videos like these, enjoy my bot gameplay, see you guys in the next one. Now I see the love of love to that life. Every time I try to breathe, I'm right, and carry me, for I love nothing. So I hope I can cope, and you should know that I know that, what's never gonna be so bad. So I'm gonna pack, go pack, oh, I'm gonna take you, I'm gonna pack, oh, I'm gonna try pack again. And once I pack again, when I drove down, while I played the worst thing I ever had, I think I could go. So I hope I can cope, and you should know that I know that, what's never gonna be so bad. So I hope I can cope, and you should know that, what's never gonna be so bad. So I hope I can cope, and you should know that, what's never gonna be so bad. So I hope I can cope, and you should know that, what's never gonna be so bad.\n",
            "NOT MORE THAN 2048 TOKEN : DATA  Welcome guys! In this video, I will show you how you can improve your aim and reflexes, or basically how to instantly aim at the enemy. This method will work for both the gyroscope players, and as well as non gyro players. Let's just assume this, as our target. So if you want to instantly aim like this, right on top of the target quickly, you just have to follow these steps. But the idea is pretty simple, you just have to get your crosshair as close as possible to the target and scope him, and then readjust your aim. In order to do that quickly, you just got to follow these steps. Step 1. Get your crosshair as close as possible to your target. Step 2. Scope him. Step 3. Correct your aim after scoping in, or adjust your aim after scoping in. If you do that quickly, this is how it should look. But you can do that even faster by combining steps, for example combining step 1 and 2, or combining step 2 and 3. What I mean is, if you scope him, it would take up to 0.2 seconds to completely scope him, so you could use that time to adjust your aim, let me show you an example. First, you have to scope in and then adjust your aim, or correct your aim. The moment you hit the scope button, you have to start adjusting your aim towards the target, in this way, you will not waste the scope opening time. This is the fastest way to aim directly onto the target, and you can achieve the maximum speed in this way. But this method works best when the target is close to your crosshair, otherwise, it wouldn't be fast and accurate. So in order to fix this issue, you just have to get your crosshair as close as possible to your target and scope him, while adjusting your aim. But you should always remember one thing, the moment you open your scope, you have to quickly adjust your aim as fast as possible. Here is an example from a classic match. So now the enemy has been spotted, and I need to get my crosshair as close as possible to the enemy. Once my crosshair is close enough to the enemy, I will open my scope, which means it will take up to 0.2 seconds to completely open the scope, so I will use that 0.2 seconds to adjust my aim from here to here, or basically correct my aim. So in this way, I will not waste any time. Even though the opponent started shooting first, I managed to take down the enemy by using this fast aiming method. Now to the training process. Just pick some random targets and start shooting at them randomly, but try to do it as fast as you can. The faster you do, the faster your reflexes will be. But I promise you that, spending at least 10 minutes each day practicing this fast aiming method, will eventually improve your reaction time and aiming skills. After about a week of practicing, you will create something called muscle memory, which will store all your movements and thing you do while playing including the bad movements. Everything will be stored in muscle memory, it will help you later to determine how much exactly you need to move your fingers or phone in order to aim right on top of the enemy. And now to the non gyroscope players, the fast aiming method is still possible, instead of using gyro, you need to use your thumb finger to move. I am not an expert in non gyro, so my movements will look slower, but you can achieve almost the same speed as a gyro player. The method is still the same, move your crosshair towards the target, once you're close enough, scope in and adjust the rest of the aim. But always remember to adjust your aim while scoping in, in this way, you will achieve the maximum speed. Anyway, that's all I got for this video. I hope you learned something new, if you did hit the like button, and subscribe for more upcoming videos like these. See you guys in the next one. Enjoy my bot gameplay. Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching. Just don't let us off my face at this time.\n"

            "[\" Hello and welcome to our Beginner's Guide to Valorant in 2022.\", ' We first made this guide a year and a half ago, but unsurprisingly, Valorant is a whole different game from back then, and as such, a new guide is much, much needed.', ' So here it is.', \" In this guide, we'll be covering all the essentials that every Valorant player must know in order to make a smooth transition into the game.\", \" So if you're a veteran player watching this thinking, but I already know most of these things, these are like the most important things you have to know in order to be good at Valorant.\", \" Well yeah, that's kind of the point, but if you're an intermediate player wanting to freshen up on the basics or a new one wanting to learn the game, this guide is just perfect for you.\", \" So make sure to like and subscribe and let's get right into it.\", \" The first thing we'll quickly go over is the game modes.\", ' The first two shown in the menu are unrated and competitive.', ' Both of these two game modes are very similar, or essentially the same.', ' The only difference being that the competitive will place you in a rank and cannot be played until you reach at least level 20, which will take quite a while.', ' And in competitive as this is a ranked and rated game mode, over times which can happen if after 24 rounds no team is won will be a bit longer in order to be more fair.', ' But more about that and the game mode itself later.', ' Generally, this is considered to be the main game mode of Valorant and is the normal way to play the game.', \" They have a primary objective which depends on your side and both of these have different objectives, which we'll talk about later.\", ' Both teams get 12 rounds on each side, or at least until one of the two teams wins 13 rounds total.', ' The two sides are attacker and defender, which will go more in depth about in this mode later.', ' Also in the lobby are two party game modes, one permanent one being Spike Rush and one being a rotating other game mode.', ' Spike Rush is a faster variant of the normal game mode, with also a lot more chaotic aspects and wacky things happening all at once.', ' Every attacker carries a spike, and orbs that have the potential to massively change the course of a round are spawned all over the map.', ' People play this game mode to relax from the stress and pressure from normal games and play Valorant in a more chill setting.', ' Other party game like I mentioned is rotational and changes over the course of the year, although currently it is escalation.', ' That being a goofy deathmatch style party game where two teams compete to finish the arms race first.', \" You'll start with standard guns like the Vandal and Phantom, but eventually you'll have to kill with Sova Shockdarts, Rez Boombots and other chaos inducing abilities.\", \" Perhaps it's not the best game mode to practice, but it sure is how it's fun.\", ' Also in the lobby are two other main game modes, that being deathmatch and custom games.', ' Match is basically a practice tool, if you die you respawn in 1.', '5 seconds, and you can buy any gun you like at all times.', \" There's no teams and the first person of 40 kills wins.\", ' People will use this to practice their gun skill, relax, or simply work on their mechanics like AMN movement.', \" Custom games are another tool that you can use to practice on your own empty maps, but more often than not it's used to play with and against friends or to play 5B5 games team vs team.\", ' Lastly to the left of the start button there will always be a smaller gray button that allows you to enter the range, where you have a shooting range and two practice tools both for planting and diffusing the spike.', ' More about that later.', \" So now that we've established the lobby, let's talk about the normal game mode and its objective.\", ' So in Valorant Ranked and Unrated, the goal is pretty simple and depends on your side.', ' Generally a round can be won in one of two ways and you need 13 rounds total in order to win a game.', ' Firstly, you can simply eliminate all 5 of your opponents as the game is played 5 vs 5.', ' If your team is the last one standing without the other team having completed the objective beforehand, your team wins the round.', \" If you're on the attacker team, your goal is to bring the spike, which can be picked up in spawn by a player at the start of the round to one of the bomb sites.\", ' Plant the spike there and let it explode.', ' The defenders are trying to do the exact opposite, which is prevent the attackers from planting the spike and otherwise diffuse it before it explodes.', ' If they manage to force the attackers to run out of time, which by the way is a minute 40, the defenders also win.', ' So yeah, pretty simple stuff.', ' Two teams, one is trying to get onto a bomb site and plant the bomb and the others are trying to prevent that.', ' In order to balance the game, the attackers are spawned further away from the bomb sites, meaning that the defenders have the advantage of being able to hold their ground and set up for an inevitable attack.', \" While attackers have the advantage of being able to bring bigger numbers to a site, there's multiple bomb sites, which all should be held by the defensive site and that while the attackers know where they want to go and the defenders don't.\", \" Alright, so before you actually start playing games, there's a few more things we should discuss.\", ' That being the fundamentals, some rules of the game, how the economy works, how the different agents and roles they fill and lastly the different maps.', \" But before we do that, let's quickly go over our question of the day.\", \" Today's question being, when did you start playing Valorant? Personally for me, I started playing all the way back on the first day of beta and I've been playing ever since.\", ' So what about you guys? When did you start? Make sure to comment when you started down below in the comment section.', ' In order to defend, or get onto these sites, four things are very important.', ' Aiming, crosshair placement, movement, and abilities.', \" The first three we'll talk about now.\", ' Aiming is a tactical shooter which makes not only tactics important, but also mostly shooting.', ' In order to shoot straight and have success, these three concepts of aiming, crosshair placement and movement are important.', \" Aim is what everyone instantly thinks about right away when they think about shooters and generally it's just about being able to place your crosshair on targets.\", ' In Valorant, that being enemies and enemy abilities.', \" Aim is important because if your aim isn't very good, it's easy to lose duels against players that you may have even outplayed tactically.\", ' Aim can be practiced in a multitude of ways.', ' The most effective one being using aim trainers like Aim Lab.', ' But you can also use practice tools like the range or death match.', \" We won't talk about training your aim too much in this video as we only have so much time.\", ' But if you want to improve that specifically, we have plenty of guides on our channel.', ' So simply subscribe to keep up to date and check out the rest of our channel for our aim guides.', ' Crosshair placement is another super important concept, arguably even more important than aiming, as it helps lessen the need for raw aim in a major way.', ' Arguing over which is pretty pointless, but the gist of it is you want both to be as best as possible.', \" With great aim and bad crosshair placement, you'll get out aim still by people with great crosshair placement and average aim.\", ' And the other way around as well.', ' A healthy mix of both is key.', \" So what is it exactly? Well crosshair placement is placing your crosshair tactically in order to minimize the amount of aiming you'll actually have to do.\", \" Basically it's putting your crosshair wherever you expect your opponents to be so that if they're indeed there, you can simply click and you'll barely have to do any aiming at all.\", \" Crosshair placement is closely linked to map knowledge so it isn't always easy for new players.\", \" It's easily practiced in death match and customs.\", ' Just keep your crosshair at head level and try to track walls and corners as best as you can.', ' If you actively put effort into the skill, it really will come with time as soon as you get more use to where players can be.', ' Aim at head level at all times and perhaps even watch pros or better players.', ' Last of the three is movement.', \" And that's got everything to do with the fact that for the most part you really can't run and shoot.\", ' Certainly, there are a few guns that make that statement a bit debatable.', ' But the best weapons are to be used shooting stationary, meaning that being able to control your movement and quickly stop when you want to shoot is most needed.', ' Quickly stopping in order to shoot is a movement technique called counterstrafing.', ' It gets its name from the players countering their strafe by strafing shortly in the opposite direction.', \" If you're going forward, you can counterstraf by quickly tapping S.\", \" If you're going left, you can do the same with D and so on.\", \" This is a technique that's best to practice by buying a vandal in the practice range and moving in between your shots versus bots.\", \" It's hard at first but becomes second nature quite quickly as long as you put in some practice.\", ' If you want more in-depth tips

happy to bring you up to speed with anything valorant.', \" Just click the link in the description if you're interested and let's keep going.\", \" So let's go over a couple more important things about the game firstly.\", \" There's the spike.\", \" We already talked about it a bit, but it's time to go a bit more in depth.\", ' Rounds are a minute and forty seconds long, and before the round ends, the attacker team will have to plant the spike in order to have a chance of winning the round.', ' Bikes can only be planted on bomb sites.', \" Then there's the designated planting area that'll light up if you're carrying the spike, like shown here.\", ' Planting the spike takes exactly four seconds, meaning you may need to start planting at least four seconds before time runs out or the defenders win.', ' Then a forty-five second timer starts before the bomb explodes.', ' The only way defenders can now prevent the attackers from winning is by diffusing the spike before it explodes.', \" Diffusing it takes seven seconds, but it does have a checkpoint at the halfway mark, meaning that if a player defuses for at least three point five seconds but does not defuse the spike completely, it'll now only take an additional three point five seconds to fully diffuse.\", ' The latest possible time you can defuse the spike is also indicated.', ' You can see this by the white circle indicator.', \" This means there's only seven seconds left to diffuse, so if you're already diffusing and you see the indicator, you have enough time.\", ' Another major part about Valorant is the economy.', \" In Valorant's main game mode, you have to buy Guns yourself, meaning that you need to make wise economic decisions in order to be able to afford the best gear.\", ' The first round of each half, so the first round on either side, is always a pistol round, where everyone will be forced to use a pistol.', ' Players only get 800 credits, and this allows them to buy either an upgraded pistol, utility, shields, or a combination of both.', ' A better gun is obviously better in order to have a better chance of winning raw aim tools, while utility can allow you to take better fights and shields are essentially extra health.', \" There's two types, light shields and heavy shields.\", ' Light shields being an extra twenty-five health and heavy being an extra fifty.', ' One of the two most important things to know for economy are that you one generally always want to buy together with your team in order to have the best chance of winning the round.', ' And two, you want to maximize your rounds with strong gear by sometimes choosing to spend less on one round, in order to be able to afford more on the next.', \" This tactic is called E-going, and it's basically saving credits in a certain round to be able to have a good buy in the following round.\", ' You can do this by looking at the buy menu and paying attention to the men next round text.', \" Here, it will showcase the minimum credits you'll have in the following rounds regardless of what happens.\", ' Even that you need to have forty-five hundred credits to buy fully with most agents.', ' But of course, that also depends on how expensive your abilities are, and whether or not you used abilities in the previous round.', \" You'll get more familiar with the economy over time.\", \" But for now, aiming for forty-five hundred credits minimum the next round, if your team can't fully buy in the current one, is always a pretty good idea.\", \" So what do we mean with a good buy? Well we mean that you're able to purchase the best guns and most or even all of your abilities together with a heavy shield.\", ' The best three guns in the game are the operator and amazing one shot kill sniper rifle, the Vandal, a great rifle, especially suited for mids a long range, and the fans of the best rifle in the game anywhere but long range.', ' Generally on defense you want to have one operator with four rifles, and on attack you want to do the same or instead five rifles depending on your preferences.', \" For the rifles you want to focus on shooting your short accurate bursts of two to four bows in order to be the most accurate, and at a close range you can also spray if it's what you prefer.\", ' While using the operator you of course want to focus on being clean and slow.', \" Missing shots with the bolt action sniper is a lot more punishing as it's going to be a while before you get your next shot in, so taking a little extra time to make sure you really hit is definitely something to be frowned upon.\", ' Of course these tips were very general, so if you want to know more about the rifles we have guides for all three of these guns, so you can definitely learn more by looking at the rest of our channel.', \" So let's get started about agents and their abilities.\", ' Each agent has three basic abilities and an ultimate.', ' One is a signature ability meaning that the agent gets at least one of them for free, and the other two can be bought in the shop.', ' The ultimate cannot be bought but rather requires anywhere from 6 to 8 ultimate points.', ' Ultimate points can be rewarded in a multitude of ways.', ' The simplest way is by getting a kill or dying.', ' Dying or getting a kill rewards the player with one ultimate point, so if a player gets three kills in a round and then dies, they in total get four ultimate points.', ' Another way an ultimate point can be received is by planting or diffusing a spike, and lastly by picking up ultimate orbs which are spawned on fixed spots on the map each round.', \" On every map but one there's two spots where the ultimate orbs are spawned, but the fracture which we'll talk about later is an exception with four ultimate orbs ready to be collected each round.\", ' Although no, these ultimate orbs disappear after around as one or the spike is planted.', ' Additionally it is important to realize that if you have enough ultimate points in order to use your ultimate, you stop saving up ultimate points even if you collect orbs.', ' Kill people or plant the spike.', \" At that point, ultimate points wise it's pretty pointless.\", \" So saving your ultimate for the best possible scenario isn't always great as it can stop you from using your ultimate multiple times in a half.\", \" Okay, so each Asian has different abilities and different roles, so let's go over all the agents' role by role starting with the duelists.\", \" The duelist role is one that's most popular, people enjoy playing duelists.\", \" As the name implies, they're best suited for finding duels and taking 1v1s.\", ' They for the most part have pretty self-sufficient kits and self-scibilities that allow them to thrive in 1v1s and win duels more easily.', ' In a team, duels are expected to find openings for the team by getting picks and go looking for 1v1s.', \" On side takes and retakes, they're generally expected to go in first.\", \" But if you have multiple duels or perhaps don't have the best duels to entry, that might not always be the most effective way to play.\", ' The duelist role feels the most agents.', \" Firstly, there's Jet.\", ' Jet is a staple of the meta as she is currently the best agent to wield the operator because of her signature dash ability that allows her to quickly dash forward, backwards, and sideways.', ' On top of that, she also has an ability that effectively allows her to dash upwards.', ' She has a short duration smoke that she can throw on the fly and her ultimate is 100% accurate weapon even while moving or jumping.', ' On top of that, Jet is currently the only agent with the pass of allowing her to hover in the air by holding down her jump key.', ' Phoenix is another duelist that has a signature Molly that can either heal him or hurt his enemies and allies.', ' He also has a small wall that he can curve any way he likes and has two flashes.', ' His ultimate is quite cheap at 6 points and allows him to walk out of his body and be able to run anywhere he likes for 10 seconds after he teleports back.', ' If he dies while using his ultimate, he also teleports back and stays alive, although he does lose his shields.', \" His ultimate is thus great for entering bombsites first as dying isn't a big deal.\", ' Neon is the newest agent in the game, at least currently, and she has her signature E which allows her to sprint and slide once every two kills.', ' She also has a bouncing grenade that stuns twice and essentially two Phoenix walls combined making it kind of like a new lane entrance, another powerful entry tool.', ' Her ultimate is a laser beam that does a whole load of damage at close range and is used in combination with her sprint.', ' Raises another duelist that has a signature grenade which does a lot of damage.', ' She has two blast packs that allow her to blow up sage walls due damage to opponents or send herself flying.', ' And she also has a robot that can clear buildings for her as it detects and blows up enemies unless they shoot it.', ' Her ultimate is a bazooka which can one shot kill and has great synergy with her blast packs.', ' Raina is another duelist that has an interesting kit that allows her to heal or go shortly invulnerable after kills.', ' Additionally she has a flash which needs to be shot in order to be effectively dealt with.', ' Her ultimate buffs her two signature abilities, allowing her to heal automatically and making her dismiss not only invulnerable but also invisible.', ' On top of that she has unlimited orbs and shoots faster.', ' Lastly we have Yorou.', ' He has a signature teleport ability which he can use to teleport or fake teleport.', ' He has a clone that runs forwards and flashes opponents when shot and on top of that he has flashbangs.', ' His ultimate allows him to go invisible and invincible and he can exit anywhere he likes plus he can use utility while in it.', \" If duelist is something for you we highly recommend that you start out with either raise or reign as both have very easy to understand kits and definitely aren't bad.\", ' But if you want to play the best of the bunch you could always decide to play Jett although playing her properly might prove to be a bit more difficult.', ' The next role we should mention is that of the initiators.', ' Initiators are essentially the role that has the best directly supportive kits and they generally have pretty good synergy with the duelist in order to get picks.', \" Basically they're what allows other teammates to thrive but a lot of them have utility that can allow them to play off themselves.\", ' The first agent under this category is Sousa.', ' Sousa has been a staple of the initiator role ever since the beta began for the game.', \" There hasn't been a single patch with Sousa but hasn't been meta and he's always been consistently good.\", ' His signature ability is a recharging recon arrow that scans through surroundings whenever it lands and highlights enemies at spots.', ' He also has shockdarts which are used the same way as the recon dart except they deal damage whenever it lands.', ' Lastly he has an owl drum which can also tag enemies to highlight them and is used as a supportive entry tool.', ' His ultimate allows him to send three massive shots through walls or any structure which is great for after plants or to kill players that are highlighted or stuck in a corner.', ' Skies another initiator that has a very supportive side but she also can be self-sufficient.', ' The reason for that are her signature flashes.', \" She gets a Q as to when she flashes an opponent in order for it to be an information gain but they're also potent kill flashes which are best used for teammates but she can also use them for herself.\", \" On top of that she has a tiger, a bit like Sousa's drum but on the ground instead and she has a heal for anyone but herself.\", ' Her ultimate scouts out the three nearest enemies and sends a secret towards them.', ' Reach is similar to Skye.', ' His signature is a recharging stun but he also has flashes and he also has a damage dealing ability that clears corners.', ' His flashes are best used for teammates but they can be used for himself.', ' His ultimate stuns and sends people flying in a large radius making it a great entry tool.', \" KO is the last initiator and he is a signature knife that he can throw to disable abilities and to allow anyone from using new ones if they're in range.\", ' On top of that he also has flashes and a Molly.', ' His ultimate disables people around him in a fairly large range and allows him to get downed instead of dying instantly whenever he dies.', ' On top of that he also fires a bit faster, another useful ultimate to entry onto sites.', ' For initiators we highly recommend playing Sousa.', ' He has always been good in the meta and he is a great agent to learn what initiators are all about.', ' He is a must pick on many maps and his only weak maps are split and fracture.', \" Overall he's a great pick.\", ' Next on the list are the controllers.', ' These are smoke wielding agents that are able to change the way people play around sites by smoking off many angles or blocking sight lines.', ' The first agent in this list is Astra.', ' She has four stars as she can place anywhere on the map and then she can transform these stars into smokes, stuns or sucks depending on what she sees fit.', \" And don't worry if you misplaced, you can always take these stars back and replace them later.\", \" Her ultimate effectively splits the map into as it's a huge wall that you cannot see, shoot or hear through.\", ' The next one is Viper.', ' She has a signature wall that she can essentially split a site into two.', ' On top of that she also has a smoke and two mollies.', ' These can also be used in synergy in order to stall diffuses by playing back with lineups for the plant spot, although this is somewhat advanced.', ' Her ultimate is very strong as it basically allows her to fill an entire bombsite with toxic smoke, which makes people lose vision and health if they enter.', \" Players won't die but they will go all the way down to 1 HP and it's easier for you to spot opponents in your ultimate than it is for them to spot you.\", ' Then we have Brimstone.', ' He can use his three smokes all at once to really set up a site take.', ' These smokes last the longest in the game and they have the advantage of not being hollow.', ' He also has a Mali and quite a potent one at that.', ' Plus he has two Stim Beacons which allows any teammates standing near them to shoot faster and even move faster now.', ' This ability used to be Mediocre at best, but ever since the speed boost got added to it it has become one of the best abilities in the game.', ' His ultimate does a lot of damage in a small zone so it allows him to either play after plant or kill people stuck in a corner.', ' Lastly we have Omen.', ' Omen is able to smoke a lot further than Brimstone can, but he is slow to place multiple smokes as he needs to be doing them one by one.', ' And he also only has two at a time.', ' On the plus side his smokes do recharge.', ' He also has a flash and he has two short range teleports.', ' His ultimate however is a teleport where he can go anywhere on the map he wants to or he can cancel it if he regrets his choice.', \" He can't even use his ultimate to pick up the spike and plant somewhere else entirely.\", ' For control we recommend playing Brimstone.', \" He's probably the easiest smoker to play and he adds so much value to the team with his Stim Packs.\", ' Vipar is very very important on some maps as well.', \" But she's a lot harder to play and thus we don't really recommend her to newer players.\", ' For the final role we have the Sentinels, which are experts at holding areas of the map.', ' They have good stalling utility and they make pushing sites very difficult.', ' The first sentinel will talk about his Sage.', \" Although generally she isn't considered to be a really good one, Sage is a good agent.\", ' She has a good kit and really helps her team.', \" But the sentinel role for her isn't a perfect fit.\", \" Although she doesn't really fit anywhere just consider her to be kind of roleless.\", ' Her signature ability is a recharging heal that can heal up to 60 health and she also has a wall that allows her to block an entrance although it can be broken quite rapidly.', \" And she also has a slow orb which makes entering a bombsite quite annoying as you'll be walking very very slowly.\", \" As you can tell these two abilities are what make her a sentinel but they're not really as strong as the other sentinel utility in the game.\", ' And lastly her ultimate is a revive which she can use to resurrect a fallen ally.', ' One of the best ultimates in the game hands down.', ' The first real sentinel is Cypher.', ' She has a signature camera which she can use to hold angles for information without the risk of dying.', ' He also has two trips which she can use to slow down and kill anyone trying to enter a bombsite or angle.', ' Lastly he has cages which are a bit like smokes except he needs to be close to the angle he wants to place them.', ' These are great to get out of angles using them as smokes but they can also be comboed up with his trip wires in order to kill people safely through a cage while they light up due to his trip.', ' His ultimate needs the body of a recently fallen foe but if he finds one he can then use it to reveal the other enemies remaining on the map.', ' A pretty good ultimating case you need to really figure out where your opponents are.', ' Then we have Killjoy.', ' Her signature ability is a turret which any opponent in may spot it does a small amounts of damage to.', ' More importantly though it slows and tags them substantially which makes it a major annoyance.', ' She also has Molotovs that can be pre-placed and activated at any time which synergizes greatly with her alarm bot that attacks and temporarily doubles the damage on enemies at spots.', ' Generally you put your alarm bot close to your mollies and if someone walks through them you can kill them quickly or at least do massive damage.', ' Entering a site that Killjoy is holding should usually be pretty painful already but then she also has a really strong ultimate, her lockdown.', \" Killjoy's ultimate when placed forces enemies to leave the area within 13 seconds or else they get detained for 8 meaning that they're not able to use their weapons, they walk slowly and thus they are easy prey.\", ' A great ultimate either for taking or sight retakes.', ' Lastly we have Chamber.', ' Chamber is an interesting sentinel but a strong one nonetheless.', ' His signature ability allows him to teleport from one place to another which either helps him rotate easier, go for aggressive peaks or do weird teleport plays to catch opponents off guard.', \" He also has trips that scans like Killjoy's alarm bot but instead slows opponents and alerts Chamber to when they go off.\", ' His other ability is essentially a better version of the sheriff except it can only have up to 8 bullets and his ultimate is a better version of the operator that also has these slow feels whenever he kills a player.', \" For sentinel's we recommend playing Killjoy.\", \" He is a great agent to get started with and she has a great kit that won't hold you back.\", \" Your agent comp and valorant definitely doesn't matter too much when you're playing not in the highest of ranks but as a general tip try to have one of each role at least as that's what's probably the easiest way to play the game.\", \" Alright with agents out of the way it's time to quickly go over the other maps.\", \" Currently there are 7 and all of them have something that's unique to them.\", ' Split initially was unique for the fact that it had ropes that you could go up and down but nowadays icebox and fracture have them too.', \" So it's more unique for the fact that everything is so close range.\", \" Split is a map where mid control is super important and having a lot of your team's resources there is the name of the game.\", ' Next up is bind.', ' Bind is unique for the teleporters it has from A-Short to B-Mid and B-Long to A-Showers which allows attackers to fake and rotate quickly through them.', ' Everything here is also very close range.', ' It usually ends up being fairly defender sided so if you have a bad attacker half stay in the game as your opponents might run into the same problems.', ' Haven is another map that is quite unique.', \" At this time for the fact that it doesn't have one not two but three bomb sites.\", ' All of which play very differently.', \" Haven is definitely the map that is the most unique for the fact that it has three bomb sites but honestly a lot of the time B is ignored so it doesn't really matter anyway.\", ' A set is a community favorite map that is unique for its closing doors both on B-Market and A-Tree.', ' It has a very important mid section which really offers a lot of control, making it an important hold for both attackers and defenders.', ' Icebox is a map that is unique for its zip lines but it also plays very interestingly.', \" The Cypher on this map is pretty much a must pick both on A and B sites and it's pretty difficult to play at a very high level.\", \" Breeze is unique for the trap door it has in the tube but perhaps more importantly because it's so open.\", ' It being extremely open again means that Vipers is more important although without it you can work through mid, tube and elbow and split all around the map to make site takes easier.', ' Lastly we have Fracture, another very unique map but at this time because the attackers can come from both sites and the defenders spawn in the middle.', ' At first it might feel really weird to play but it actually kind of works and makes it quite a fun map to play.', \" Well guys that's going to wrap it up, good to see you stuck along all the way to the end and hopefully we answered all of your questions.\", \" If you have any left make sure to comment them down below and we'll go over them there or in future videos.\", \" Thanks for watching and make sure to subscribe and we'll see you in the next one.\"]\n"

            "NEW DATA =  Hello and welcome to our Beginner's Guide to Valorant in 2022. We first made this guide a year and a half ago, but unsurprisingly, Valorant is a whole different game from back then, and as such, a new guide is much, much needed. So here it is. In this guide, we'll be covering all the essentials that every Valorant player must know in order to make a smooth transition into the game. So if you're a veteran player watching this thinking, but I already know most of these things, these are like the most important things you have to know in order to be good at Valorant. Well yeah, that's kind of the point, but if you're an intermediate player wanting to freshen up on the basics or a new one wanting to learn the game, this guide is just perfect for you. So make sure to like and subscribe and let's get right into it. The first thing we'll quickly go over is the game modes. The first two shown in the menu are unrated and competitive. Both of these two game modes are very similar, or essentially the same. The only difference being that the competitive will place you in a rank and cannot be played until you reach at least level 20, which will take quite a while. And in competitive as this is a ranked and rated game mode, over times which can happen if after 24 rounds no team is won will be a bit longer in order to be more fair. But more about that and the game mode itself later. Generally, this is considered to be the main game mode of Valorant and is the normal way to play the game. They have a primary objective which depends on your side and both of these have different objectives, which we'll talk about later. Both teams get 12 rounds on each side, or at least until one of the two teams wins 13 rounds total. The two sides are attacker and defender, which will go more in depth about in this mode later. Also in the lobby are two party game modes, one permanent one being Spike Rush and one being a rotating other game mode. Spike Rush is a faster variant of the normal game mode, with also a lot more chaotic aspects and wacky things happening all at once. Every attacker carries a spike, and orbs that have the potential to massively change the course of a round are spawned all over the map. People play this game mode to relax from the stress and pressure from normal games and play Valorant in a more chill setting. Other party game like I mentioned is rotational and changes over the course of the year, although currently it is escalation. That being a goofy deathmatch style party game where two teams compete to finish the arms race first. You'll start with standard guns like the Vandal and Phantom, but eventually you'll have to kill with Sova Shockdarts, Rez Boombots and other chaos inducing abilities. Perhaps it's not the best game mode to practice, but it sure is how it's fun. Also in the lobby are two other main game modes, that being deathmatch and custom games. Match is basically a practice tool, if you die you respawn in 1.5 seconds, and you can buy any gun you like at all times. There's no teams and the first person of 40 kills wins. People will use this to practice their gun skill, relax, or simply work on their mechanics like AMN movement. Custom games are another tool that you can use to practice on your own empty maps, but more often than not it's used to play with and against friends or to play 5B5 games team vs team. Lastly to the left of the start button there will always be a smaller gray button that allows you to enter the range, where you have a shooting range and two practice tools both for planting and diffusing the spike. More about that later. So now that we've established the lobby, let's talk about the normal game mode and its objective. So in Valorant Ranked and Unrated, the goal is pretty simple and depends on your side. Generally a round can be won in one of two ways and you need 13 rounds total in order to win a game. Firstly, you can simply eliminate all 5 of your opponents as the game is played 5 vs 5. If your team is the last one standing without the other team having completed the objective beforehand, your team wins the round. If you're on the attacker team, your goal is to bring the spike, which can be picked up in spawn by a player at the start of the round to one of the bomb sites. Plant the spike there and let it explode. The defenders are trying to do the exact opposite, which is prevent the attackers from planting the spike and otherwise diffuse it before it explodes. If they manage to force the attackers to run out of time, which by the way is a minute 40, the defenders also win. So yeah, pretty simple stuff. Two teams, one is trying to get onto a bomb site and plant the bomb and the others are trying to prevent that. In order to balance the game, the attackers are spawned further away from the bomb sites, meaning that the defenders have the advantage of being able to hold their ground and set up for an inevitable attack. While attackers have the advantage of being able to bring bigger numbers to a site, there's multiple bomb sites, which all should be held by the defensive site and that while the attackers know where they want to go and the defenders don't. Alright, so before you actually start playing games, there's a few more things we should discuss. That being the fundamentals, some rules of the game, how the economy works, how the different agents and roles they fill and lastly the different maps. But before we do that, let's quickly go over our question of the day. Today's question being, when did you start playing Valorant? Personally for me, I started playing all the way back on the first day of beta and I've been playing ever since. So what about you guys? When did you start? Make sure to comment when you started down below in the comment section. In order to defend, or get onto these sites, four things are very important. Aiming, crosshair placement, movement, and abilities. The first three we'll talk about now. Aiming is a tactical shooter which makes not only tactics important, but also mostly shooting. In order to shoot straight and have success, these three concepts of aiming, crosshair placement and movement are important. Aim is what everyone instantly thinks about right away when they think about shooters and generally it's just about being able to place your crosshair on targets. In Valorant, that being enemies and enemy abilities. Aim is important because if your aim isn't very good, it's easy to lose duels against players that you may have even outplayed tactically. Aim can be practiced in a multitude of ways. The most effective one being using aim trainers like Aim Lab. But you can also use practice tools like the range or death match. We won't talk about training your aim too much in this video as we only have so much time. But if you want to improve that specifically, we have plenty of guides on our channel. So simply subscribe to keep up to date and check out the rest of our channel for our aim guides. Crosshair placement is another super important concept, arguably even more important than aiming, as it helps lessen the need for raw aim in a major way. Arguing over which is pretty pointless, but the gist of it is you want both to be as best as possible. With great aim and bad crosshair placement, you'll get out aim still by people with great crosshair placement and average aim. And the other way around as well. A healthy mix of both is key. So what is it exactly? Well crosshair placement is placing your crosshair tactically in order to minimize the amount of aiming you'll actually have to do. Basically it's putting your crosshair wherever you expect your opponents to be so that if they're indeed there, you can simply click and you'll barely have to do any aiming at all. Crosshair placement is closely linked to map knowledge so it isn't always easy for new players. It's easily practiced in death match and customs. Just keep your crosshair at head level and try to track walls and corners as best as you can. If you actively put effort into the skill, it really will come with time as soon as you get more use to where players can be. Aim at head level at all times and perhaps even watch pros or better players. Last of the three is movement. And that's got everything to do with the fact that for the most part you really can't run and shoot. Certainly, there are a few guns that make that statement a bit debatable. But the best weapons are to be used shooting stationary, meaning that being able to control your movement and quickly stop when you want to shoot is most needed. Quickly stopping in order to shoot is a movement technique called counterstrafing. It gets its name from the players countering their strafe by strafing shortly in the opposite direction. If you're going forward, you can counterstraf by quickly tapping S. If you're going left, you can do the same with D and so on. This is a technique that's best to practice by buying a vandal in the practice range and moving in between your shots versus bots. It's hard at first but becomes second nature quite quickly as long as you put in some practice.

            "NEW DATA =  Just click the link in the description if you're interested and let's keep going. So let's go over a couple more important things about the game firstly. There's the spike. We already talked about it a bit, but it's time to go a bit more in depth. Rounds are a minute and forty seconds long, and before the round ends, the attacker team will have to plant the spike in order to have a chance of winning the round. Bikes can only be planted on bomb sites. Then there's the designated planting area that'll light up if you're carrying the spike, like shown here. Planting the spike takes exactly four seconds, meaning you may need to start planting at least four seconds before time runs out or the defenders win. Then a forty-five second timer starts before the bomb explodes. The only way defenders can now prevent the attackers from winning is by diffusing the spike before it explodes. Diffusing it takes seven seconds, but it does have a checkpoint at the halfway mark, meaning that if a player defuses for at least three point five seconds but does not defuse the spike completely, it'll now only take an additional three point five seconds to fully diffuse. The latest possible time you can defuse the spike is also indicated. You can see this by the white circle indicator. This means there's only seven seconds left to diffuse, so if you're already diffusing and you see the indicator, you have enough time. Another major part about Valorant is the economy. In Valorant's main game mode, you have to buy Guns yourself, meaning that you need to make wise economic decisions in order to be able to afford the best gear. The first round of each half, so the first round on either side, is always a pistol round, where everyone will be forced to use a pistol. Players only get 800 credits, and this allows them to buy either an upgraded pistol, utility, shields, or a combination of both. A better gun is obviously better in order to have a better chance of winning raw aim tools, while utility can allow you to take better fights and shields are essentially extra health. There's two types, light shields and heavy shields. Light shields being an extra twenty-five health and heavy being an extra fifty. One of the two most important things to know for economy are that you one generally always want to buy together with your team in order to have the best chance of winning the round. And two, you want to maximize your rounds with strong gear by sometimes choosing to spend less on one round, in order to be able to afford more on the next. This tactic is called E-going, and it's basically saving credits in a certain round to be able to have a good buy in the following round. You can do this by looking at the buy menu and paying attention to the men next round text. Here, it will showcase the minimum credits you'll have in the following rounds regardless of what happens. Even that you need to have forty-five hundred credits to buy fully with most agents. But of course, that also depends on how expensive your abilities are, and whether or not you used abilities in the previous round. You'll get more familiar with the economy over time. But for now, aiming for forty-five hundred credits minimum the next round, if your team can't fully buy in the current one, is always a pretty good idea. So what do we mean with a good buy? Well we mean that you're able to purchase the best guns and most or even all of your abilities together with a heavy shield. The best three guns in the game are the operator and amazing one shot kill sniper rifle, the Vandal, a great rifle, especially suited for mids a long range, and the fans of the best rifle in the game anywhere but long range. Generally on defense you want to have one operator with four rifles, and on attack you want to do the same or instead five rifles depending on your preferences. For the rifles you want to focus on shooting your short accurate bursts of two to four bows in order to be the most accurate, and at a close range you can also spray if it's what you prefer. While using the operator you of course want to focus on being clean and slow. Missing shots with the bolt action sniper is a lot more punishing as it's going to be a while before you get your next shot in, so taking a little extra time to make sure you really hit is definitely something to be frowned upon. Of course these tips were very general, so if you want to know more about the rifles we have guides for all three of these guns, so you can definitely learn more by looking at the rest of our channel. So let's get started about agents and their abilities. Each agent has three basic abilities and an ultimate. One is a signature ability meaning that the agent gets at least one of them for free, and the other two can be bought in the shop. The ultimate cannot be bought but rather requires anywhere from 6 to 8 ultimate points. Ultimate points can be rewarded in a multitude of ways. The simplest way is by getting a kill or dying. Dying or getting a kill rewards the player with one ultimate point, so if a player gets three kills in a round and then dies, they in total get four ultimate points. Another way an ultimate point can be received is by planting or diffusing a spike, and lastly by picking up ultimate orbs which are spawned on fixed spots on the map each round. On every map but one there's two spots where the ultimate orbs are spawned, but the fracture which we'll talk about later is an exception with four ultimate orbs ready to be collected each round. Although no, these ultimate orbs disappear after around as one or the spike is planted. Additionally it is important to realize that if you have enough ultimate points in order to use your ultimate, you stop saving up ultimate points even if you collect orbs. Kill people or plant the spike. At that point, ultimate points wise it's pretty pointless. So saving your ultimate for the best possible scenario isn't always great as it can stop you from using your ultimate multiple times in a half. Okay, so each Asian has different abilities and different roles, so let's go over all the agents' role by role starting with the duelists. The duelist role is one that's most popular, people enjoy playing duelists. As the name implies, they're best suited for finding duels and taking 1v1s. They for the most part have pretty self-sufficient kits and self-scibilities that allow them to thrive in 1v1s and win duels more easily. In a team, duels are expected to find openings for the team by getting picks and go looking for 1v1s. On side takes and retakes, they're generally expected to go in first. But if you have multiple duels or perhaps don't have the best duels to entry, that might not always be the most effective way to play. The duelist role feels the most agents. Firstly, there's Jet. Jet is a staple of the meta as she is currently the best agent to wield the operator because of her signature dash ability that allows her to quickly dash forward, backwards, and sideways. On top of that, she also has an ability that effectively allows her to dash upwards. She has a short duration smoke that she can throw on the fly and her ultimate is 100% accurate weapon even while moving or jumping. On top of that, Jet is currently the only agent with the pass of allowing her to hover in the air by holding down her jump key. Phoenix is another duelist that has a signature Molly that can either heal him or hurt his enemies and allies. He also has a small wall that he can curve any way he likes and has two flashes. His ultimate is quite cheap at 6 points and allows him to walk out of his body and be able to run anywhere he likes for 10 seconds after he teleports back. If he dies while using his ultimate, he also teleports back and stays alive, although he does lose his shields. His ultimate is thus great for entering bombsites first as dying isn't a big deal. Neon is the newest agent in the game, at least currently, and she has her signature E which allows her to sprint and slide once every two kills. She also has a bouncing grenade that stuns twice and essentially two Phoenix walls combined making it kind of like a new lane entrance, another powerful entry tool. Her ultimate is a laser beam that does a whole load of damage at close range and is used in combination with her sprint. Raises another duelist that has a signature grenade which does a lot of damage. She has two blast packs that allow her to blow up sage walls due damage to opponents or send herself flying. And she also has a robot that can clear buildings for her as it detects and blows up enemies unless they shoot it. Her ultimate is a bazooka which can one shot kill and has great synergy with her blast packs. Raina is another duelist that has an interesting kit that allows her to heal or go shortly invulnerable after kills. Additionally she has a flash which needs to be shot in order to be effectively dealt with. Her ultimate buffs her two signature abilities, allowing her to heal automatically and making her dismiss not only invulnerable but also invisible. On top of that she has unlimited orbs and shoots faster. Lastly we have Yorou. He has a signature teleport ability which he can use to teleport or fake teleport. He has a clone that runs forwards and flashes opponents when shot and on top of that he has flashbangs. His ultimate allows him to go invisible and invincible and he can exit anywhere he likes plus he can use utility while in it. If duelist is something for you we highly recommend that you start out with either raise or reign as both have very easy to understand kits and definitely aren't bad.\n"

            "NEW DATA =  But if you want to play the best of the bunch you could always decide to play Jett although playing her properly might prove to be a bit more difficult. The next role we should mention is that of the initiators. Initiators are essentially the role that has the best directly supportive kits and they generally have pretty good synergy with the duelist in order to get picks. Basically they're what allows other teammates to thrive but a lot of them have utility that can allow them to play off themselves. The first agent under this category is Sousa. Sousa has been a staple of the initiator role ever since the beta began for the game. There hasn't been a single patch with Sousa but hasn't been meta and he's always been consistently good. His signature ability is a recharging recon arrow that scans through surroundings whenever it lands and highlights enemies at spots. He also has shockdarts which are used the same way as the recon dart except they deal damage whenever it lands. Lastly he has an owl drum which can also tag enemies to highlight them and is used as a supportive entry tool. His ultimate allows him to send three massive shots through walls or any structure which is great for after plants or to kill players that are highlighted or stuck in a corner. Skies another initiator that has a very supportive side but she also can be self-sufficient. The reason for that are her signature flashes. She gets a Q as to when she flashes an opponent in order for it to be an information gain but they're also potent kill flashes which are best used for teammates but she can also use them for herself. On top of that she has a tiger, a bit like Sousa's drum but on the ground instead and she has a heal for anyone but herself. Her ultimate scouts out the three nearest enemies and sends a secret towards them. Reach is similar to Skye. His signature is a recharging stun but he also has flashes and he also has a damage dealing ability that clears corners. His flashes are best used for teammates but they can be used for himself. His ultimate stuns and sends people flying in a large radius making it a great entry tool. KO is the last initiator and he is a signature knife that he can throw to disable abilities and to allow anyone from using new ones if they're in range. On top of that he also has flashes and a Molly. His ultimate disables people around him in a fairly large range and allows him to get downed instead of dying instantly whenever he dies. On top of that he also fires a bit faster, another useful ultimate to entry onto sites. For initiators we highly recommend playing Sousa. He has always been good in the meta and he is a great agent to learn what initiators are all about. He is a must pick on many maps and his only weak maps are split and fracture. Overall he's a great pick. Next on the list are the controllers. These are smoke wielding agents that are able to change the way people play around sites by smoking off many angles or blocking sight lines. The first agent in this list is Astra. She has four stars as she can place anywhere on the map and then she can transform these stars into smokes, stuns or sucks depending on what she sees fit. And don't worry if you misplaced, you can always take these stars back and replace them later. Her ultimate effectively splits the map into as it's a huge wall that you cannot see, shoot or hear through. The next one is Viper. She has a signature wall that she can essentially split a site into two. On top of that she also has a smoke and two mollies. These can also be used in synergy in order to stall diffuses by playing back with lineups for the plant spot, although this is somewhat advanced. Her ultimate is very strong as it basically allows her to fill an entire bombsite with toxic smoke, which makes people lose vision and health if they enter. Players won't die but they will go all the way down to 1 HP and it's easier for you to spot opponents in your ultimate than it is for them to spot you. Then we have Brimstone. He can use his three smokes all at once to really set up a site take. These smokes last the longest in the game and they have the advantage of not being hollow. He also has a Mali and quite a potent one at that. Plus he has two Stim Beacons which allows any teammates standing near them to shoot faster and even move faster now. This ability used to be Mediocre at best, but ever since the speed boost got added to it it has become one of the best abilities in the game. His ultimate does a lot of damage in a small zone so it allows him to either play after plant or kill people stuck in a corner. Lastly we have Omen. Omen is able to smoke a lot further than Brimstone can, but he is slow to place multiple smokes as he needs to be doing them one by one. And he also only has two at a time. On the plus side his smokes do recharge. He also has a flash and he has two short range teleports. His ultimate however is a teleport where he can go anywhere on the map he wants to or he can cancel it if he regrets his choice. He can't even use his ultimate to pick up the spike and plant somewhere else entirely. For control we recommend playing Brimstone. He's probably the easiest smoker to play and he adds so much value to the team with his Stim Packs. Vipar is very very important on some maps as well. But she's a lot harder to play and thus we don't really recommend her to newer players. For the final role we have the Sentinels, which are experts at holding areas of the map. They have good stalling utility and they make pushing sites very difficult. The first sentinel will talk about his Sage. Although generally she isn't considered to be a really good one, Sage is a good agent. She has a good kit and really helps her team. But the sentinel role for her isn't a perfect fit. Although she doesn't really fit anywhere just consider her to be kind of roleless. Her signature ability is a recharging heal that can heal up to 60 health and she also has a wall that allows her to block an entrance although it can be broken quite rapidly. And she also has a slow orb which makes entering a bombsite quite annoying as you'll be walking very very slowly. As you can tell these two abilities are what make her a sentinel but they're not really as strong as the other sentinel utility in the game. And lastly her ultimate is a revive which she can use to resurrect a fallen ally. One of the best ultimates in the game hands down. The first real sentinel is Cypher. She has a signature camera which she can use to hold angles for information without the risk of dying. He also has two trips which she can use to slow down and kill anyone trying to enter a bombsite or angle. Lastly he has cages which are a bit like smokes except he needs to be close to the angle he wants to place them. These are great to get out of angles using them as smokes but they can also be comboed up with his trip wires in order to kill people safely through a cage while they light up due to his trip. His ultimate needs the body of a recently fallen foe but if he finds one he can then use it to reveal the other enemies remaining on the map. A pretty good ultimating case you need to really figure out where your opponents are. Then we have Killjoy. Her signature ability is a turret which any opponent in may spot it does a small amounts of damage to. More importantly though it slows and tags them substantially which makes it a major annoyance. She also has Molotovs that can be pre-placed and activated at any time which synergizes greatly with her alarm bot that attacks and temporarily doubles the damage on enemies at spots. Generally you put your alarm bot close to your mollies and if someone walks through them you can kill them quickly or at least do massive damage. Entering a site that Killjoy is holding should usually be pretty painful already but then she also has a really strong ultimate, her lockdown. Killjoy's ultimate when placed forces enemies to leave the area within 13 seconds or else they get detained for 8 meaning that they're not able to use their weapons, they walk slowly and thus they are easy prey. A great ultimate either for taking or sight retakes. Lastly we have Chamber. Chamber is an interesting sentinel but a strong one nonetheless. His signature ability allows him to teleport from one place to another which either helps him rotate easier, go for aggressive peaks or do weird teleport plays to catch opponents off guard. He also has trips that scans like Killjoy's alarm bot but instead slows opponents and alerts Chamber to when they go off. His other ability is essentially a better version of the sheriff except it can only have up to 8 bullets and his ultimate is a better version of the operator that also has these slow feels whenever he kills a player. For sentinel's we recommend playing Killjoy. He is a great agent to get started with and she has a great kit that won't hold you back. Your agent comp and valorant definitely doesn't matter too much when you're playing not in the highest of ranks but as a general tip try to have one of each role at least as that's what's probably the easiest way to play the game. Alright with agents out of the way it's time to quickly go over the other maps. Currently there are 7 and all of them have something that's unique to them. Split initially was unique for the fact that it had ropes that you could go up and down but nowadays icebox and fracture have them too.\n",
            "REM DATA =  So it's more unique for the fact that everything is so close range. Split is a map where mid control is super important and having a lot of your team's resources there is the name of the game. Next up is bind. Bind is unique for the teleporters it has from A-Short to B-Mid and B-Long to A-Showers which allows attackers to fake and rotate quickly through them. Everything here is also very close range. It usually ends up being fairly defender sided so if you have a bad attacker half stay in the game as your opponents might run into the same problems. Haven is another map that is quite unique. At this time for the fact that it doesn't have one not two but three bomb sites. All of which play very differently. Haven is definitely the map that is the most unique for the fact that it has three bomb sites but honestly a lot of the time B is ignored so it doesn't really matter anyway. A set is a community favorite map that is unique for its closing doors both on B-Market and A-Tree. It has a very important mid section which really offers a lot of control, making it an important hold for both attackers and defenders. Icebox is a map that is unique for its zip lines but it also plays very interestingly. The Cypher on this map is pretty much a must pick both on A and B sites and it's pretty difficult to play at a very high level. Breeze is unique for the trap door it has in the tube but perhaps more importantly because it's so open. It being extremely open again means that Vipers is more important although without it you can work through mid, tube and elbow and split all around the map to make site takes easier. Lastly we have Fracture, another very unique map but at this time because the attackers can come from both sites and the defenders spawn in the middle. At first it might feel really weird to play but it actually kind of works and makes it quite a fun map to play. Well guys that's going to wrap it up, good to see you stuck along all the way to the end and hopefully we answered all of your questions. If you have any left make sure to comment them down below and we'll go over them there or in future videos. Thanks for watching and make sure to subscribe and we'll see you in the next one.\n"

            "NEW DATA =  Today I'm gonna give you 50 fallerant tips and tricks. In this video we're gonna focus on agent abilities, so I won't give specific tips and tricks on maps or guns. Before we start the video I want to thank everyone we recently got more subscribers than human catchery and now our next goal is the world of cats. With your help we can do it. Now let's hop into the first trick. If you want to flash with Phoenix try not to stand against the wall but try to stand diagonal to the wall. This way you have a little bit more time to pre-aim the enemies and the enemies have a little bit less time to react. If you place your wall with sage don't throw an orb immediately after you place the wall. I see a lot of people doing this in lower elo but it's useless. Unless you're gonna peek after you throw your orbs, like here in mid split. The stem beacon of brimstone gives you a rapid fire. This does not work with pistol so stop using it in pistol rounds. Unless someone got a frenzy then it will affect the fire rate. If you play on the defending side with Fiper try to save your wall for the retake. Your wall is really helpful if you want to retake a side like you see in the clip in the background. Also you decide when you put your wall down so when you have coffe put it down early so you can kill the enemy easy peasy. If you time it correctly you can use your shrouded step over breaches ult made. If you're playing Omen and you got a sage on your team on a scent you can use this combo to get to a side. I'm not sure who came up with this trick but definitely not me. I got it from flexing jar so credits to him. If you want to flash the teleporter with you Roo and want to push behind it don't do it in the middle of the teleporter. It will most likely flash yourself. Instead of using it in the middle use it a little bit to the right of the teleporter. It will bounce against the door, go back and will flash behind you. If enemies are looking at you they will get flashed and you can kill them easy peasy. If you want to use your ult after a double jump with race don't double jump and then use your ult. As you see in the background it will take a while before you can fire your ult. Instead of using your ult at the end use your ult in between the double jumps then you can fire your ult immediately. A nice combo with breaches is using your E over here and then using your C immediately after. A lot of people are tend to jump over to that side but when they are stunned your C will kill them easy peasy. If killjoy you can throw your nouns from in the middle of container. If you activate it it will hit almost all the plant spots on B side. You can make a one way with killjoy and it's H well. The good thing is that you can almost make it everywhere. The bad thing is that it cost a lot of abilities and you can only shoot on the enemies feet. But it can be useful somewhere so try it out. Use your ult and updraft combo with jet to get free kills from unexpected angles. You can see a few examples of this in the background. I feel a bit silly to explain this but I still get a lot of questions how you can do it. You can press R to change your form in your smoke ability with Omen. Reina her flash got a maximum range. So for example if you want to flash C long don't flash it over here because it does not reach the back of C long. The same goes for cipher and killjoy and other H twitch setups by the way. Be unpredictable so use different camera spots, strip wires, killjoy turrets, F3 round. You can hide your nano swarm behind this spot. The enemy will not see it. You can also hide your alarm bot and your nano swarm in this spot over here. Just keep in mind that they both make a lot of noise so the enemies might find it anyway. In the background you see me flying and spraying. They also call this an attack helicopter. If you like this attack helicopter please give this video a thumbs up. It really helps growing my channel. Thank you. When you use your flashbang with sky you can hold your ability button to aim where your bird flies. You don't have to do it like you see in this clip. Your bird fly automatically around corners so you can push behind it. The first option is good to use if you want to fly your bird over buildings like you see in the clip in the background. If you want to retake A on haven with killjoy, place your ult over here. If you look on the minimap you see only one place enemy players can hide. Then stand over here, match the top left corner of your ability with the top left corner of the window and throw your Molotov. This nano swarm will nicely land in the corner. Here an essential lineup for a short with Phoenix aim at the top of the building and do a small running throw. This is a very very nice Molotov. When playing with Yuru, throw your flashbang so the enemies has a little time as possible to react. So in this case don't throw it against the wall on site but throw it against the window or even better use the ground. You have to be careful with this one though because you might flash yourself. Instead of throwing your nano swarms on the boom every round try to learn linux with killjoy. Like this one. Stand in this corner aim a little bit left of the roof and easy piece you got the easy lineup. Throw this nano swarm before the enemies are planting. If you're playing jet always keep moving if you use your ult. I see a lot of people standing still, then shoot and then walk away. But instead of doing that just keep walking and keep shooting. It's a little harder to do but it will help you get easy kills. Which raise on a scent this is an easy running and jumping throw that got me a lot of kills. If you are playing with a sage on your team stand over here and split. Let their use your wall and then use your double jump with ult combo to look to a ramp. This will cost a lot of abilities but it might work you never know. If you want to defend the boom with fiper it's highly recommended to use your smoke in combination with your poison. You can do this by throwing your cue on the spike and using your sea ability with a lineup. Here two easy line ups on default plant on split. For both line ups standing in this corner for the lineup behind the billboard aim at the top right of the light of that building and for the other line up aim at the bottom left of the light of the building. These line ups will nicely land on default plant easy piece. Here an easy lineup with race that I use all the time just stand over here aim a little bit under the middle of the top box and do a jumping throw. If you want to get on the tube fast you can use this double jump. With the correct timing you can stay alive if you use your Phoenix ult before the race ult hits you. With Omen you can use your shrouded step before you enter the teleporter to fake a teleporter. You can press your right mouse button to place two fake outs on the ground. After that you can activate them for anywhere on the map. If you rule ults inside Fyper's ult Fyper can see him. Instead of using the same sofa lineup back to back try to learn line ups where the arrows will land on the same time. Most of the time the enemies will expect the second arrow so with this double line ups the enemies won't expect it and will die instantly if both arrows hit them on the same time. For a very easy cipher one way stand against this corner aim over there and throw your smoke. You can use this one way in combination with your camera for easy kills. If you play with an operator and you make a kill with Reyna or Jett always use your eability to get to safety. Reyna and Jett are the only two agents that can get to safety after they make a kill. That's why they are in my opinion the best agents to play with an operator. If you want to go for an aggressive peek with Jett on icebox stand against the barrier, spam your dash ability and make a kill easy peasy. This one is a little risky but I believe you can do it. Don't use the same wall at the same place, F-L-R down with Sage. Try to wait a little bit or even better try to go on a different side each round. For my own experience if people are playing Sage on A F-R down I always go to B or C. I avoid Sage because Sage is a pain to push you know. Be unpredictable. Be unpredictable. Be unpredictable. Guys I'm really trying my best at this English thing but I'm not good so be sorry. If you want to smoke something try to always smoke on the opposite side of the wall. In this case you have to smoke on that side. This will give you a lot of advantage. In the clip in the background you see someone who didn't do it because the enemy omen smoked more the side than CT. I could push on the right side of the smoke without people from Elbow seeing me. If you want to do the Eference Jones trick shoot your arrow with full charge and two bounces on the ground then shoot one arrow with full charge and two bounces in the air. Good luck with this one.\n",
            "REM DATA =  Try to use your jet smoke as a one way. The good thing about this is that you can use it almost everywhere. You will have to practice how high your smoke has to be. If you want to use your ult with Brimstone try to use it and peak immediately after it. This way you can get a lot of free kills. If the Tasmanian Tiger is running towards you it may be better to don't shoot it but just walk away. This way you give the enemy sky less information. Because the fishing of the Tasmanian Tiger is not that high you can just walk away without the enemy seeing you. And sorry for last video I called it a Tiger but the Tasmanian Tiger is something different. Sorry for that. If you want to push with Breach try sometimes to flash two times this might fake the enemy. Well this is the end of the video. If I didn't mention something let me know in the comments and I might make a part two. If you liked this video please give it a like it really helps. Subscribe and I'll see you in the next one.\n"

            "[\" You ever learned something that you're just like, man, I really wish I knew that when I started playing.\", \" Well, that's literally what this video is about.\", ' Those bits of information that are literally making the world of difference between you getting better at the game, and you just walking around like a bot.', ' My name is the King Live, and in the beta I was placed in Iron 2.', \" But by fighting through blood, sweat, and tears, I was able to make my way all the way up to Immortal, and I'm going to give you guys all the things that I think are the most important things for Valorant players to know in the game.\", \" And some of these things are things that players just aren't going to tell you.\", \" I know I don't mean their secret tips that nobody's heard of, but what I mean is I've been making Valorant Guide content for pretty much the last year, and guides pretty much just consistently tell you the same things.\", \" So let me try to give you things that you maybe don't hear all that often.\", \" The first thing being that aim isn't as important as you think.\", \" Don't get me wrong, having good aim can be a great asset.\", ' But people treat the game especially when starting out, as if aim is the only important factor.', \" When you're learning the game, you should focus on improving your raw aim, of course.\", ' This means doing aim trainers and death match and actively trying to take duels in your matches.', ' But there will be a point where your aim will be good enough, and that point will come sooner than you think.', ' People miss shots.', ' Rather than telling yourself your aim could have been better, try to ask yourself how could you have made the shots easier to hit? This sort of segues perfectly into the next tip, which is bad teammates can still be perfectly set up.', \" Listen guys, your teammates might be terrible, but I've seen this in practice so many times from our Smurf commentaries on our website, where we have a radiant level player matched up with bad teammates, and they were able to make these bad teammates look like exceptional players.\", ' And they do this by playing off of them and turning their mistakes into an advantage.', ' Basically the logic here is, if your teammate is going to do something stupid, you yourself can try to make that stupid play less stupid.', \" I play a lot of Omen for example, so a way that I'll do that is if my teammate is going to wide swing somebody for no reason, I'll be there to blind that target when they actually take the fight.\", \" Another way is if your teammate is just sitting alone in a one and done, try to bait for them, because if you don't they're just going to get themselves killed.\", ' Furthermore what this means is that if you communicate with your teammates clearly, and correctly, you can generally, generally count on them to trade you.', \" Trust me, I've practiced this with my friends who are literally brand new to the game, and if you tell them when you're going to swing and say swing with me, and then count it down, regardless of how good or bad they are as a player, they will generally be able to get a trade.\", \" So, I'm going to go onto the third tip though, and that is that teamplay is what separates radiance from immortals, and obviously the comparison radiance to immortals isn't relevant to a lot of people watching this video, and that's not to throw any shade, everybody starts somewhere, but the thing you need to realize is that you can start working on your teamplay right now, whatever rank you are.\", ' Specifically what I mean is that radiant players are constantly aware of what their teammates are doing and how to play off of them.', ' A great way to play off of your teammates as well is by comboing utility, for example, using an omen blind at the same time your sova uses his recon, or using a raise ultimate at the same time your sky-olds.', \" There are a lot of different ways that you can combo utility, but these are things that you'll see pros do all of the time, because one ability alone is generally a lot easier to handle than two to three abilities being comboed together.\", \" If there's anything I've learned from a mortal level lobbies and analyzing pro plays, it's that immortal players are still too much of solo players.\", \" Immortal players are really good at playing solo, but they don't really understand teamplay all that much and it holds them back.\", \" And that means it's probably holding you back in your ranks too.\", \" The next tip is actually a little bit relative, but at least in my experience and what I've heard from pros, tends included, playing less is generally the secret to ranking up more.\", \" Now obviously there's a potential to rank up more by playing more, and the best way to get better at the game is by playing the game.\", ' But in my experience, the best way to rank up is to play just a few games a day and actually focus during them.', \" Don't tell us, don't rage when you miss shots and don't get upset with your teammates.\", ' Just play a few games and genuinely enjoy them.', \" So play better, you'll notice you win more and when you lose, you won't go on a loss streak because you'll quit playing.\", ' Obviously the counterpart to this is queuing a lot, and hey, if you win every game doing this, yeah, obviously it will be faster.', \" But that's not normally how it's going to go, and that's why if you're looking to climb I suggest to play less.\", \" Tip number five has to deal with team comps, and that tip is it's absolutely necessary to have a controller on your team.\", \" I don't care if it's Viper, Omen, Brimstone, or Astra, you need to have a controller on your team, otherwise you're going to have a very rough time in the game.\", \" Personally for me, the game's not even fun without a controller, there are just too many angles and it's incredibly obnoxious to deal with.\", \" This isn't just my take though, I've heard this from pro players like Fanatic Boaster as well.\", \" You can get away without a Sentinel, you can get away without an initiator, but if your team doesn't have a controller, it's going to be a rough time and you should save yourself the trouble in either dodge or lock a controller.\", \" And that's actually what brings us to our sixth tip, which is everything else doesn't matter.\", \" If you've got a controller, don't lock a Sentinel if you don't know how to play a Sentinel.\", \" Don't lock an initiator if you don't know how to play initiator.\", \" Listen, I'd rather have you lock an agent that you know how to play well rather than locking an agent that you've never played before because it's good on a map.\", ' The only exception to this rule I might say is that Viper is pretty necessary on Breeze and Sage is pretty necessary on Icebox.', ' You can obviously still win without them, but they are both very, very strong on those respective maps, and I do believe without them it does make the game quite a bit more difficult.', \" But hey, if you don't know how to use those agents on those maps, not going to matter all that much.\", \" Remember, it's the utility that makes agents different and if you don't know how to use their utility, they're useless.\", \" So don't pick an agent that you don't know how to play for the purpose of filling, unless it's controller.\", \" This next one is a bit more difficult to do, but what I've started to realize most recently is that when you're dealing with the team that likes to just full rush everything, the best way to deal with them is to set up crossfires and shoot them down when they're coming in.\", ' You will not, and I repeat, will not be able to deal with a 5-man rush solo when they are using utility and barreling down on site.', ' You need your teammates to help you, and you need to position in a way where you and your teammates can play off of each other.', \" Obviously throwing down a Molly to block the entrance gives your team more time to rotate, and this can be super helpful, but if you're setting up on a site in a way where you're going to be taking a 1v1 duel, you really want to avoid doing this.\", \" The way most site defenses work is you'll have one player in a position where they'll take first contact, and then you'll have another player who will peek off of their contact.\", ' But if instead you have one player who takes contact solo, and then they die, and then another player who takes contact solo, and then they die, like what have you accomplished?

            "NEW DATA =  You ever learned something that you're just like, man, I really wish I knew that when I started playing. Well, that's literally what this video is about. Those bits of information that are literally making the world of difference between you getting better at the game, and you just walking around like a bot. My name is the King Live, and in the beta I was placed in Iron 2. But by fighting through blood, sweat, and tears, I was able to make my way all the way up to Immortal, and I'm going to give you guys all the things that I think are the most important things for Valorant players to know in the game. And some of these things are things that players just aren't going to tell you. I know I don't mean their secret tips that nobody's heard of, but what I mean is I've been making Valorant Guide content for pretty much the last year, and guides pretty much just consistently tell you the same things. So let me try to give you things that you maybe don't hear all that often. The first thing being that aim isn't as important as you think. Don't get me wrong, having good aim can be a great asset. But people treat the game especially when starting out, as if aim is the only important factor. When you're learning the game, you should focus on improving your raw aim, of course. This means doing aim trainers and death match and actively trying to take duels in your matches. But there will be a point where your aim will be good enough, and that point will come sooner than you think. People miss shots. Rather than telling yourself your aim could have been better, try to ask yourself how could you have made the shots easier to hit? This sort of segues perfectly into the next tip, which is bad teammates can still be perfectly set up. Listen guys, your teammates might be terrible, but I've seen this in practice so many times from our Smurf commentaries on our website, where we have a radiant level player matched up with bad teammates, and they were able to make these bad teammates look like exceptional players. And they do this by playing off of them and turning their mistakes into an advantage. Basically the logic here is, if your teammate is going to do something stupid, you yourself can try to make that stupid play less stupid. I play a lot of Omen for example, so a way that I'll do that is if my teammate is going to wide swing somebody for no reason, I'll be there to blind that target when they actually take the fight. Another way is if your teammate is just sitting alone in a one and done, try to bait for them, because if you don't they're just going to get themselves killed. Furthermore what this means is that if you communicate with your teammates clearly, and correctly, you can generally, generally count on them to trade you. Trust me, I've practiced this with my friends who are literally brand new to the game, and if you tell them when you're going to swing and say swing with me, and then count it down, regardless of how good or bad they are as a player, they will generally be able to get a trade. So, I'm going to go onto the third tip though, and that is that teamplay is what separates radiance from immortals, and obviously the comparison radiance to immortals isn't relevant to a lot of people watching this video, and that's not to throw any shade, everybody starts somewhere, but the thing you need to realize is that you can start working on your teamplay right now, whatever rank you are. Specifically what I mean is that radiant players are constantly aware of what their teammates are doing and how to play off of them. A great way to play off of your teammates as well is by comboing utility, for example, using an omen blind at the same time your sova uses his recon, or using a raise ultimate at the same time your sky-olds. There are a lot of different ways that you can combo utility, but these are things that you'll see pros do all of the time, because one ability alone is generally a lot easier to handle than two to three abilities being comboed together. If there's anything I've learned from a mortal level lobbies and analyzing pro plays, it's that immortal players are still too much of solo players. Immortal players are really good at playing solo, but they don't really understand teamplay all that much and it holds them back. And that means it's probably holding you back in your ranks too. The next tip is actually a little bit relative, but at least in my experience and what I've heard from pros, tends included, playing less is generally the secret to ranking up more. Now obviously there's a potential to rank up more by playing more, and the best way to get better at the game is by playing the game. But in my experience, the best way to rank up is to play just a few games a day and actually focus during them. Don't tell us, don't rage when you miss shots and don't get upset with your teammates. Just play a few games and genuinely enjoy them. So play better, you'll notice you win more and when you lose, you won't go on a loss streak because you'll quit playing. Obviously the counterpart to this is queuing a lot, and hey, if you win every game doing this, yeah, obviously it will be faster. But that's not normally how it's going to go, and that's why if you're looking to climb I suggest to play less. Tip number five has to deal with team comps, and that tip is it's absolutely necessary to have a controller on your team. I don't care if it's Viper, Omen, Brimstone, or Astra, you need to have a controller on your team, otherwise you're going to have a very rough time in the game. Personally for me, the game's not even fun without a controller, there are just too many angles and it's incredibly obnoxious to deal with. This isn't just my take though, I've heard this from pro players like Fanatic Boaster as well. You can get away without a Sentinel, you can get away without an initiator, but if your team doesn't have a controller, it's going to be a rough time and you should save yourself the trouble in either dodge or lock a controller. And that's actually what brings us to our sixth tip, which is everything else doesn't matter. If you've got a controller, don't lock a Sentinel if you don't know how to play a Sentinel. Don't lock an initiator if you don't know how to play initiator. Listen, I'd rather have you lock an agent that you know how to play well rather than locking an agent that you've never played before because it's good on a map. The only exception to this rule I might say is that Viper is pretty necessary on Breeze and Sage is pretty necessary on Icebox. You can obviously still win without them, but they are both very, very strong on those respective maps, and I do believe without them it does make the game quite a bit more difficult. But hey, if you don't know how to use those agents on those maps, not going to matter all that much. Remember, it's the utility that makes agents different and if you don't know how to use their utility, they're useless. So don't pick an agent that you don't know how to play for the purpose of filling, unless it's controller. This next one is a bit more difficult to do, but what I've started to realize most recently is that when you're dealing with the team that likes to just full rush everything, the best way to deal with them is to set up crossfires and shoot them down when they're coming in. You will not, and I repeat, will not be able to deal with a 5-man rush solo when they are using utility and barreling down on site. You need your teammates to help you, and you need to position in a way where you and your teammates can play off of each other. Obviously throwing down a Molly to block the entrance gives your team more time to rotate, and this can be super helpful, but if you're setting up on a site in a way where you're going to be taking a 1v1 duel, you really want to avoid doing this. The way most site defenses work is you'll have one player in a position where they'll take first contact, and then you'll have another player who will peek off of their contact. But if instead you have one player who takes contact solo, and then they die, and then another player who takes contact solo, and then they die, like what have you accomplished? Set up a crossfire instead with your teammates on site, and stop setting up solo. Play off of your teammates, and you'll get more kills and win more games. Moving on to tip number 8, the topic of crosshair placement is kind of meamed up, but the reason it's meamed up is because crosshair placement is basically the whole game. At the end of the day, if your crosshair placement was perfect like many players seem to believe there's is, you'd win every single 1v1 duel because all you would have to do is click. This is why it's so important to learn when you're starting out, but many lower rank players kind of just shrug it off and go, yeah, yeah. Like yeah, the reason we say it a lot is because it's a very large part of the game. That's why a lot of the job of the teacher is to find new interesting ways to teach a subject players maybe have already heard about, because clearly the ways we're teaching it before didn't stick, but maybe this one will.\n"

            "NEW DATA =  If you're below the rank of a mortal, your crosshair placement probably sucks. Try to work on it a little bit. The ninth tip though is that baiting your teammates is really easy to do, and I don't mean a good type of baiting, I mean the bad type of baiting. Sometimes your headspace is just not in the place it should be, and you don't even realize you're baiting your teammates incredibly hard. Maybe you're sitting there inside of a smoke doing nothing, or maybe you're playing in a position far away when you could be pushing up to help them. Bating your teammates is really easy to do accidentally, and it takes active attention not to do. Bating isn't something that you just flip a switch and suddenly you're not doing it. Even the best players have times where their rounds play out and they're like, oh shoot, I accidentally baited the heck out of that guy. It happens, but by acknowledging that it happens, we can try to make it happen less. Always keep an eye on your map, and try to think about how you can be helping your teammates during the round, and it will reduce the amount that you accidentally bait them. Speaking of looking at the map though, let's talk about the opposite thing that has gone on and has all killed far too much, and that is looking at the map at the worst time and getting killed because of this. One of the ways I've learned to avoid this is if you're holding an angle rather than looking at the map, try asking your teammates what they're seeing. Hopefully if you're holding an angle you can rely on callouts for your teammates just a little bit more and that way you won't have to glance at the map all the time. Because theoretically they all have the same information on their map that you do, right? So hopefully if you ask people what they're seeing, they can say the same exact thing that you will see. This obviously isn't going to always work because sometimes people just won't talk, but in that case it might be best just to give up the angle and look at the map and then repeat afterwards to save yourself the risk. This next tip is something that's a bit more obvious, but still so many players have a bad habit of this and that is pushing smokes that they really shouldn't be pushing. We've all been there where we're pushing a smoke thinking I really shouldn't be pushing this. Like I said, so many players have this bad habit of needing to push every single smoke that they see and just waiting a little bit for the smoke to dissipate can oftentimes be so much better. You don't need to push every single smoke that you see, it's okay to let a smoke exist and hold it. And what you'll find is, like I said, many players have this bad habit, so if you hold a smoke, oftentimes players will push them and you'll pick up a free kill because of this. Like I said though, there are sometimes when pushing a smoke is okay, but start thinking about the situations where you don't have to a little bit more and you'll probably save yourself a number of times. Tip number 12 takes us to probably one of the biggest things I wish I knew, which is communication is one of the harder skills to improve in Valorant. I think this one literally just revolves around getting people out of their comfort zone, so many gamers are incredibly introverted and trying to get people to communicate effectively in game can be really hard. That being said, that's why it's so valuable if you can get people who actually know how to communicate well on a team. I wish when I started out in Valorant, I practiced making callouts just a little bit more and actively communicated what my intentions were within the round because it would have helped me improve a lot faster. This is something I still struggle with today and it's because communication is very hard and for many players it's the thing holding them back. Tip number 13 is another problem that most players have though, which is they probably use counterstrafing wrong. Lots of people know what counterstrafing is, but they don't actively use it within their matches. Instead what they do is they go, yeah, yeah counterstrafing. And then every time they take an engagement, they will full crouch in the open and get them self-killed. Listen, if you're going to be taking a prolonged engagement in the open or you're fighting multiple enemies at the same time, you need to be counterstrafing between your shots. Otherwise you're going to get traded out or worse, killed before you can even get one. Counterstrafing doesn't actually make you accurate, faster, and Valorant, so the point of counterstrafing isn't to hit your shots faster, the point of it is to make yourself more difficult to hit. Tip number 14 takes us into something that many players, especially in low elo struggle with though, and that is relying too much on gimmicks. What is a gimmick though? Well, those are things like Wombo, combo, killjoy, setup, cypher setup, sage wall, boost, aggressive, omen plays, double-shock dart line-ups, stuff like that. And listen, gimmicks can be really cool, but what you need to understand though is that they're gimmicks for a reason and you're probably going to peek with them eventually. Whether that peek is goal 3 or that peek is immortal, eventually you're going to run into players that they don't work against and you're going to have to adapt. This doesn't mean remove those gimmicks from your playbook though, this just means to understand when they will work and when they won't work, and use them sparingly. Lots of players don't have this skill, but when you develop this skill, that's when you'll run into some of the best and most exciting players to watch. That sort of ties into our next tip though, which is to pay attention to pro play. When you watch pro play, it will be a lot more simple to understand what standard play looks like and how you can sort of copy what they do. Now obviously pro play and matchmaking are super different, but you'll start to pick up on basic concepts of things that are good. You'll start to understand how pros play clutch situations, how they use their utility to grab territory, how they play around their teammates really well, people roast the casters and valour to lot, but some of them actually do a really excellent job of explaining what players are doing and why they're doing it. When casting, generally there's going to be a play by playcaster and then a colorcaster. The colorcaster's job is to generally provide analysis during the game, to give viewers a detailed understanding of why pros might do what they do, and then the play by play castors' job is to generally cover the more height moments and break down the more intense visuals on the screen for the viewer. If you're looking to improve, try to listen to what the colorcaster is saying during the slower parts of the round to have a good understanding of what is going on in the game. Many of these guys do a really good job of this. Moving on to number 16 though, and we say this a lot on the channel, if you haven't been recording your games yet you really should. One of the easiest ways to pick out your mistakes and valourant is to look back through them when you're not playing and think about what you could have done better. Luckily we recently launched our own community discord where you can submit your own vods for us to review, so if you're looking to get your games looked at by us and potentially featured in a video, be sure to check that out in the description below. Moving on to tip number 17 though, and that's going to be to try to find players better than you to play with. Maybe you find these guys in your matches who just seem to be really strong players, or maybe you go out of your way to find a community to play with. Generally if you put yourself out there you'll be able to find players who are better than you, and that's how you're going to improve faster. Because at the end of the day playing with people better than you is going to make things more challenging, and things that are more challenging always offer more for you to learn and grow from. What I highly suggest is that like I said before, if you encounter good players in your matches, add them, and then try to play a few matches with them. You never know who you'll meet along the way. Something else to keep in mind with people in Valorant is tip number 18 which is toxic players will never say anything useful, and this is in reference obviously to players who don't want to mute players because they might make necessary callouts. Remember earlier how I said that you pretty much have all of the information you need on your map? I mean don't get me wrong, there are some things that you can't get from your map, such as audio or your teammates intentions, but you can still kind of read your teammates intentions by just looking at how they're positioned, and you can also still see enemies on the map when they appear. So trust me when I say somebody who is being an absolute jerk to you is never going to start being like, hey I'm swinging this corner, can you trade me? Or I hear 4B either and spawn flanking you, this stuff just isn't going to happen. Trust me I have thousands of hours in this game now, rather than making helpful callouts what they're going to do is bait you and then they'll get upset with you after you die after they bait you.\n",
            "REM DATA =  It's not worth it, just mute these guys and try your best to not only win the game, but enjoy the game. Because you shouldn't be letting some jerk on the internet run an experience for you that is supposed to be fun. Moving on to tip number 19 though, and that is you don't need to be a hero to climb. A lot of players have this really warped mentality that they need to hard carry every single game that they're in, but that's just not the truth. You have to play well, don't get me wrong, and I would say that you have to pull your weight, but if you want to climb, you need to do your job, and a little bit more. That should be your goal every single game. Don't expect to hard carry, and there are going to be games where you might actually have to hard carry to win. But if you want to climb, matchmaking should do a good job of balancing teams, meaning that all you have to do is pull your weight, and a little bit more. Like I said, this won't always be true, but most of the time it will, and this will prevent you from having the whole mentality where it's you versus the world because it's really not. You have four other teammates on your team that are all the same rank as you, so stop trying to act like a hero and just try to do your job. You'll be surprised how much this helps. Getting onto our last thing that I wish I knew when I started playing Valorant though, and that's that if you wanted to see how some of the best players in the game carry effectively in any rank, that is all available to you at skillcapped.com. For real, we just got a bunch of new radiant level players who are helping us showcase exactly how you can get out of any rank in the game, and this is also backed by a rank improvement guarantee, meaning that if you don't see the improvement, it's literally no risk. This is by far the fastest way to improve a Valorant, so if you're looking to join the higher ranks to become the best player that you can be, be sure to check out skillcapped.com linked in the description below.\n"

            "NEW DATA =  Butch grits on me where you at your motivation guy is back. Your friend, the one and only Keith Allen, I'm so pumped up. Because that's my job to make you guys the best Fortnite player you can possibly be. Oh yeah, and also the best person you could possibly be. You know, it's all about confidence. I'm what you guys have to have confidence. I know a lot of us struggle with confidence. But you know what? I want you to speak positive over your life. Speak positive. You know, over your mind and over your situations. And I promise you, you're going to see yourself get more confident day by day. I know because I struggled with confidence for so long. But I'm telling you you could do it. Listen, I'm so excited today because we're going to take this to the next level. All right, today we're going to give you guys a crash course in Fortnite. That's right, ladies and gentlemen, 30 tips back to back. Let's get to help you achieve better skills. All right, we've got a wide variety of tips. Some familiar, others new, and we're going to rapid fire them through your wall and into your box. So you guys got to get ready. But before we do, man, you guys got to taste my bunch of crunch. I'm telling you right now, I'm not trying to promote them. But I'm telling you, it is delicious. Check it out. My favorite candy is that bunch of crunch. Let's get this going. All right, guys, number one strategic planning. Always begin before players even drop. While waiting in the lobby, be sure to check the trajectory of the bus driver. This is going to let you know how close the path will be to your choice of landing spots. Be prepared to make adjustments as you see fit. Always have more than one possible landing spot. All right, number two. Landing spots can be contested or uncontested, depending on the meta and the benefits of landing at certain locations. Some players want to go for eliminations and will end up landing along with multiple others looking to do the same thing. Number three. Landing uncontested is sometimes lug base. Even if you find a nice landing spot with a few chests all to yourself, you know, always assume someone that would have the same idea. I mean, you may not be fighting the entire lobby, but all it takes is just one fast player reaching the loop first for your entire game plan to really fall apart. Trust me, I've been there. Number four. If you plan to use Chuck's Flash or Harvest Chuck Barrel, all right, try to wait to your shields. All right, 50, so you can just top it off. However, if you are in a fight and need the hills, then feel free to do anything you can do to survive in the fight. Number five. Seven vaults are scattered all across the island in a similar fashion to IO basis. You're going to need multiple players to open these vaults if you're playing solo. However, you can bypass the security check by just knocking down a guard and carrying them over to the scanner. Soon, you're going to be able to get your hands on all that loot, man. If you have no guards, chickens are going to work as well. Number six. The sniper rifle this season does not have a 200 damage headshot. So keep this in mind, guys, if you plan to use this weapon since it can just be easy to expect to really have that much damage causing you some confusion. If you land this shot, but don't make the kill. Regardless, like the snipers in excellent choice, for knocking down a good majority of your opponents health and really forcing them to really take the defensive. Are you going to need some accuracy for that striker pump, right? How about check it out, aim lab, by clicking on the link below. You know, with so many routines to choose from and even customize, you are guaranteed to see improvement in your aim. Don't believe us? Alright, aim lab has you covered with statistics on your progress that points out exactly what you need to be working on from mouse movement to keeping your crosshairs on opponents. Number seven. Another weapon with no 200 headshot is this striker pump. However, players have adapted by double pumping. This method is just sure way to use the new shotgun. However, it does require you to use up two inventory slots. Number eight. The auto shotgun deals even less damage and requires you to be in close proximity to your opponent to deal the maximum amount of damage. This weapon is best used when you want to strike quickly and swap out another weapon. Number nine. The ADS rifle, while recently nerfed, is still a great weapon for those peaking since the accuracy of the weapon allows you to get those shots in at an angle. So try just testing it out by creating a box with windows. And so it could be the key to really impossible peak shots I'm telling you. Number ten. Sometimes, you know, what you need are items from the vending machines or from various characters. Luckily, alright, in one of the most recent updates, the amount of gold on the island has been increased. Remember, gold does not carry over in competitive. So if you want to make sure that you make use of it, you need to take bounties, open chefs and eliminate enemies. Number eleven. The higher you are in the competitive ranks, the more often you're going to have to deal with storm surge. I'm telling you right now. So this is really because players are just more skilled at staying alive, which means the game must slowly eliminate those who deal with the lease amount of damage. As the storm closes. Luckily, you're going to lose health gradually, so you still have a chance to find an enemy, deal some serious damage, and get yourself out of storm surge. Number twelve. Slide cancelling does not increase your speed, alright? One of the misconceptions from sliding comes from the fact that it feels like just moving faster. Sliding will move you faster when you're going down a slope, and will definitely make you a harder target to hit. Number thirteen. Now, if you want to move faster while sliding, try doing it right as you land from a deployment, alright? Hold down the slide key or button while descending. Move forward or backwards to just build up momentum, and then finally, the moment that you touch ground, you should see yourself boosting forwards. Number fourteen. Alright, one of the common misconceptions and mistakes that you probably make is holding down the forwards button or stick when sliding forwards. The mentality behind that is, you know, just holding the stick allows you to keep sliding forwards. The truth is, man, that it really does nothing, and the slide will lose momentum at the same pace if you were holding it. So, you should break out of that mentality, and instead, use those free thumbs to perform other functions. So, this is also going to keep use of those same keys to do a complete 360 while sliding. Number fifteen. Alright, so now for some game stage tips. So, during the early game, the most important actions you need to keep in mind are choosing your spot, landing, reaching the loop quickly, and building up your mat inventory, alright? This is like the most hectic stage of the game since every player starts off with nothing. And you need to really find a weapon to defend yourself if you want to make it out of spot. Number sixteen. During the midgame, you're going to be rotating towards this center of the circle. You're going to need to outrun the storm and start building up your loop from rare status to legendary. The fights you encounter during this time will also give more intense as the outcome is more dependent on aiming and building rather than, you know, those who just reached the weapon first. Number seventeen. The late game will require you guys to keep building and keep trying to take the high ground. The high ground is your best friend, and when I only give you guys a good vantage point of the enemies below you, but will also make it easier to keep up with the storm. Number eighteen. The redwood trees will always fall towards the closest player, even if the trajectory of gravity seems to say otherwise. Like this will do 100 damage upon impact and can be useful for clearing builds. You can also keep hitting the leftover log to deal additional damage to enemies and builds. This time, the damage is based on momentum. Number nineteen. Alright, guzzle juice recently got buffed, making it a much quicker way to heal. However, the previous drawback of not being able to take damage is also an effect. This includes storm damage, which will cancel off the healing. On the other hand, fall damage will not have an effect on your guzzle juice use, and, you know, with the new buff, it just makes it easier to recover after taking fall damage. Twenty. Now, if you are looking to run through the storm while also healing, consider using medmiss since it can heal you in like the storm at 5 health per click. And it does allow you to move while doing so. This can create an extra protective layer that keeps your health nice and green as you try to outrun the storm. Number twenty one. Quad coppers are one of the best ways to rotate this season. With their signature boost, you can get great airtime when you practice boosting mid jump. It can get you around the map much quicker than a nama vehicle can, even with the all terrain tires. Number twenty two. Chilli Chug is available from Lama's, and there is a guaranteed spot near the Lama NPC at name and name.\n",
            "REM DATA =  This Lama will always spawn there every game so you can use it to get max max and a variety of use fight ups. Number twenty three. For even more max, keep an eye out for that raft that spawns at the edge of the map. Each game, the spawn location is going to change, making it a dynamic POI. There, you can farm more than 100 wood from the mast alone and even harvest. Chug barrels, consumables from the non boxes as well as a guaranteed supply crate and henchmen chest. Number twenty four. Alright, so if you're having trouble finding the web slingers then don't worry guys, we got your cover. Alright, so first you need to drop down to the daily bugle and start exploring while keeping your eye on the walls. Eventually you should be able to find a backpack webbed up to the wall, interact with this, and it's going to drop the web slingers for you to use. Twenty five. Visual side effects have been buffed and turning them on will allow you to see all the sorts of activity from a distance such as Uncoming vehicles, players healing, and even the players themselves as they enter your proximity. One player who is currently using this system is Bouga and you can see why. I mean it offers a huge advantage and we recommend using this for as long as it remains this powerful. Twenty six. Invading boxes got easier this season with the new sliding mechanic. This requires you to deal some damage to the wall, you want to bypass, you know build a corner front of it, then slide down a game of momentum and knock down the wall. Do this correctly and you should be able to slide through before your opponent has the time to refortify the box. Alright guys, number 27. Speaking of destroying boxes, the SNG seems to be the goat to weapon this season. Due to its rapid, you know, rate of fire and damage. This has resulted in a spray and pray playstyle. We're knocking down a wall and dealing some damage because more viable. However, remember guys if you want to use this strategy, make sure that you have enough ammo to pull it off. Like, don't want to see yourself running out of mid-fight, right? And so if you need help not wasting ammo, you got to check out aim lab. Don't waste those bullets, land more shots and take down your opponents today. You can do it. Twenty eight. Consistency is more important than speed. Like if you're in a build battle or a box fight, you need to make sure that you're placing the right bills and the right places, right? Otherwise, there are no strategic methods to your builds and you are only doing so for the sake of building. So train your mechanics on creative to get the fuel for building and editing. Then find a sensitivity that's gonna allow you to have the most building accuracy. And as long as you know what you want to do while building, you're gonna have a clear path towards your goal. Twenty nine. Never forget what your capable love went down. Like you can actually perform multiple actions besides crawling. Like you can use the grapple one down to get away, but also you can use jump pads and webs to just bounce around. Also, like if you drop your inventory, you can lighten the load and move faster. Thirty. Alright, so one of the newest items, the Chuck sprinkler is a great way of keeping your team healthy. So if it has been released by the time this video was uploaded, then you're definitely gonna know what to do. Drop that sprinkler down and everybody benefits. Just be careful guys, not to heal your enemies. Bunch of grussami, that's gonna be it for today's video. Listen, be sure to leave a like, sub to the channel. Man, also feel free to leave a comment and just let us know if there's anything that you would be interested in learning more about. Man, I hope you guys appreciated these tips and I hope you guys use these to your advantage. I believe in you, I am your number one fan. The guy who's rooting for you, the one who is motivating you, man, each and every day your friend, the one and only, Keith, Alan, your motivation. I'll see you in the next one, peace.\n"

more.', \" There might be one or two kind of basic things in here, but I truly believe that a lot of these skills and things that I'm going to talk about in this video are simply just not used in day to day play on Fortnite.\", \" I have roughly around 15 clips that I'm going to show you whether they're fast, whether they're slow, so the hope is not only by watching these will you familiarize yourself with these moves, and if you haven't seen it in a while you're going to retry that muscle memory and hop into your next game and use it.\", \" Don't forget to use codecat me the item shop, check out the merch link down below to support, and let's hop into this.\", ' I was watching this video and I saw a clicks box the player really really nice.', \" It's a 2v1 and this guy has the wall on clicks and neck.\", ' What clicks did was he looked in the empty space to place a stair above that wall.', \" That way he could break through the wall and the guy would be technically underneath the stair, the player would go in and he'd be full box.\", \" When I first saw this I was really surprised because it's a really unique way to box a player when you're trying to full send in their face.\", ' Most of these clips are for Mr.', ' Savage because I always learn stuff when I watch his gameplay.', \" I've seen him do this move lots of times but this is the one clip I found about it.\", ' Usually what people tend to do on Fortnite is edit open and do a 50-50.', \" In this situation if you have a stair kind of blocking you and there's a guy on the opposite side of the wall, what Savage does is edit the bottom right four tiles just like this and then goes for peace control and now he's protected behind this little right hand peek.\", ' Personally in my experience of playing Fortnite I have never ever seen a player do an edit like this on me.', \" That's why when I saw this I had a double take because it's super useful and super optimum.\", ' This next play that tons of pros use works surprisingly more than you think.', \" This is one of the most basic ones I'm gonna talk about in this video but it's a fake outplay.\", \" Once he grabbed the wall he scuffed the edit so he acts like he's running away.\", \" Turning your character's body completely away from the enemy sometimes makes him think that you're gonna leave.\", \" This in turn lowers their guard a little bit and then that way he turns around doesn't edit and even though it's like a 50-50 he doesn't expect it and he gets the kill.\", ' Savage is a literal king at doing this move he does it all the time.', ' I always tell people on Fortnite to make two boxes so that you could box fight a player outside that box.', ' Being the aggressor you see how Mr.', ' Savage dropped down on the wall he knows that lots of players make more than one box just like this.', \" To outplay the situation you see how he doesn't drop down on the center of the wall.\", \" Once he takes the wall does the edit you see how he plays the angle so extreme to the point where the guy can't even shoot him back.\", \" It's really important to not just make the edit but play the angle too.\", \" This is a general reminder that I see pros do all the time and after they shoot someone if they don't hit them hard and they know that they're still gonna aggress onto the box.\", ' Lots of times what you see people do just like Mr.', ' Savage did right here he shoots the player and since the wall is weak with any gun after he resets what he does is that he instantly tarps away after he makes the shot just in case the guy runs into his box.', \" This gives him time to counter what he's doing and think about the right edit to make in this situation after.\", ' Not only that he buy himself time to get some heals up.', \" Go out of your way to next time you get on Fortnite if you're not too good with it already to learn how to tarp away after you shoot someone or even when you get cracked.\", ' In slow-mo it looks like this.', ' This is a very slept on play that I talked about in an old 100-tip video.', ' What I see Mr.', ' Savage do a ton in his arena fights.', \" When he goes to drop down on a player's wall usually what happens is that a lot of average people what they're including me honestly will just drop down right on the center of the stair.\", ' This does work a ton for me especially if I keep the pressure up really nice at the start but nonetheless this move that I see Savage doing is something that I just kind of forgot about.', ' You see how when he lands on the box he edits the stair in half.', ' He missed time to floor so he had to reset it up again.', ' Here it is when he side jumps.', ' He smacks the wall once and then instantly looks down the place that counterpiece control before the other guy can.', \" When he makes the edit he's behind the right hand peak.\", \" The red mogul's skin is literally looking clueless trying to figure out what's going on.\", \" I've noticed that a tendency that Mr.\", ' Savage has is that he makes his opponents kind of sit there behind an open edit.', \" It's because he's doing things so fast and just so differently that it kind of confuses people.\", \" That's why I want to show you guys videos just like this where you can use other pros moves so that way you might be able to do the same thing like he's doing.\", ' Not only for you guys but for me as well because I need to start doing it.', ' Similar move but in a different way.', \" How many times have you tried the box a player but they end up being on top of the stair? He have edits the stair in the spot that they're on and then he can use that stair as a right hand peak to jump up and shoot them.\", \" He did it twice in the same play and then this was the last guy so he was trying to freestyle and do something crazy so he didn't end up going for the final shot but this is still a very viable option for you guys to do in your fight.\", ' This is how pros play arena and this is probably how you should be doing it as well.', \" What I noticed Savage doesn't literally every pro.\", ' They always try to hop into the box the first few couple seconds the fight starts to happen.', ' Even without the help the advantage and arena I tell people to do this all the time because it wraps up fights super fast but if you do struggle with learning how to jump in the boxes and ending fights quick this is probably the best way to go about it.', \" Constantly trying to jump into the box at the very start of the fight is super super important because people don't know what to expect at the beginning of the fight.\", \" Usually how it works if you miss the first time jumping into the box then that player is going to be more defensive and it's going to be harder to jump in the second time.\", \" That's why pros who have mastered the jumping into box and just out aiming people get high kill games.\", \" That's all because they're really good at getting that first initial jump in on the box.\", \" The more you do this this play style of constantly just thinking you're going to have better aim than the other person the way better you're going to be able to get at the game because eventually you're going to learn the mistakes about what went wrong when you tried to jump in the box.\", \" After doing that for a long time you're going to realize exactly what you need to fix so that you can do it over and over and over and then you drop 20 bucks.\", \" Granite Deplay didn't work here but Savage knows exactly what he's doing.\", \" He's very good at making it seem like he's leaving that box.\", ' He jumps up off the cone but swings down at a very steep angle to try and wall replace the wall.', \" If you're an average player and this is done to you the person inside the box might think oh he left so they'll stop holding the wall.\", ' This is just high IQ when Mr.', ' Savage is playing.', ' A move like this could work even against a very sweaty player.', ' It was a fail and he ends up killing the guy anyway but this just goes to show that he does do this.', ' This clip starts out he pre-fires, he peace controls, he goes crazy and the clip is looking real nice.', ' Towards the end this guy is on his wall kind of spraying with an SMG.', \" He thought that after he reset the wall there's only one wall in there that's not hit so if he could try and claim the peace control to where he thinks the enemy is going to go then he'll wrap up the kill but notice how he does it.\", \" He's on the cone and to be honest I never thought about using my walls like this.\", ' He jumps up over the cone to drag the walls over and down.', \" That's a really unique way to get a wall on a guy and I think that's pretty optimal but the guy ends up spraying in his face nonetheless still a really good move.\", \" Here's a little trick that you might have missed to grab the wall before the other player even thinks about.\", \" What Savage does right here is as he's turning the corner he's looking down at a really steep angle.\", ' The average player might not be doing this but when you turn corners you kind of want to flick the wall into position.', ' I think I can say that this is a very unique tip to try and grab the wall first before them.', ' Have you ever gotten third party from the front end the back until the tower Savage is directly in the center of the map.', \" People have eyes on him from everywhere but one thing he does that I've actually seen on the pros do as well.\", \" If you're getting shot from two positions instead of trying to spin around and place walls what people will do is place a wall in front of them and then turbo build a stair and a wall at the same time.\", \" It's constantly switching between the two builds.\", \" This blocks your front and your back but you don't want to sit there and think that it's going to hold forever obviously because bullets bleed through in chapter 3 especially but this is definitely a good way to stop a few bullets from hitting you.\", ' It just so happens that the second he tried to edit through the wall the stair broke and he took a lot more damage than expected.', ' This is a move that even against pros will work so so well.', \" He knows that there's a guy above the side jump that he's about to complete.\", ' What Savage is really really good at doing is pickaxing walls before anything else before any other builds are placed.', ' He smacks the wall then places a floor and a stair to exploit in on the second pickaxe.', \" This is something

            "NEW DATA =  I always have my eyes on a lot of pros on Fortnite. Essentially what this video is going to be is high IQ plays that not a lot of people do on Fortnite that I see pros doing a lot more. There might be one or two kind of basic things in here, but I truly believe that a lot of these skills and things that I'm going to talk about in this video are simply just not used in day to day play on Fortnite. I have roughly around 15 clips that I'm going to show you whether they're fast, whether they're slow, so the hope is not only by watching these will you familiarize yourself with these moves, and if you haven't seen it in a while you're going to retry that muscle memory and hop into your next game and use it. Don't forget to use codecat me the item shop, check out the merch link down below to support, and let's hop into this. I was watching this video and I saw a clicks box the player really really nice. It's a 2v1 and this guy has the wall on clicks and neck. What clicks did was he looked in the empty space to place a stair above that wall. That way he could break through the wall and the guy would be technically underneath the stair, the player would go in and he'd be full box. When I first saw this I was really surprised because it's a really unique way to box a player when you're trying to full send in their face. Most of these clips are for Mr. Savage because I always learn stuff when I watch his gameplay. I've seen him do this move lots of times but this is the one clip I found about it. Usually what people tend to do on Fortnite is edit open and do a 50-50. In this situation if you have a stair kind of blocking you and there's a guy on the opposite side of the wall, what Savage does is edit the bottom right four tiles just like this and then goes for peace control and now he's protected behind this little right hand peek. Personally in my experience of playing Fortnite I have never ever seen a player do an edit like this on me. That's why when I saw this I had a double take because it's super useful and super optimum. This next play that tons of pros use works surprisingly more than you think. This is one of the most basic ones I'm gonna talk about in this video but it's a fake outplay. Once he grabbed the wall he scuffed the edit so he acts like he's running away. Turning your character's body completely away from the enemy sometimes makes him think that you're gonna leave. This in turn lowers their guard a little bit and then that way he turns around doesn't edit and even though it's like a 50-50 he doesn't expect it and he gets the kill. Savage is a literal king at doing this move he does it all the time. I always tell people on Fortnite to make two boxes so that you could box fight a player outside that box. Being the aggressor you see how Mr. Savage dropped down on the wall he knows that lots of players make more than one box just like this. To outplay the situation you see how he doesn't drop down on the center of the wall. Once he takes the wall does the edit you see how he plays the angle so extreme to the point where the guy can't even shoot him back. It's really important to not just make the edit but play the angle too. This is a general reminder that I see pros do all the time and after they shoot someone if they don't hit them hard and they know that they're still gonna aggress onto the box. Lots of times what you see people do just like Mr. Savage did right here he shoots the player and since the wall is weak with any gun after he resets what he does is that he instantly tarps away after he makes the shot just in case the guy runs into his box. This gives him time to counter what he's doing and think about the right edit to make in this situation after. Not only that he buy himself time to get some heals up. Go out of your way to next time you get on Fortnite if you're not too good with it already to learn how to tarp away after you shoot someone or even when you get cracked. In slow-mo it looks like this. This is a very slept on play that I talked about in an old 100-tip video. What I see Mr. Savage do a ton in his arena fights. When he goes to drop down on a player's wall usually what happens is that a lot of average people what they're including me honestly will just drop down right on the center of the stair. This does work a ton for me especially if I keep the pressure up really nice at the start but nonetheless this move that I see Savage doing is something that I just kind of forgot about. You see how when he lands on the box he edits the stair in half. He missed time to floor so he had to reset it up again. Here it is when he side jumps. He smacks the wall once and then instantly looks down the place that counterpiece control before the other guy can. When he makes the edit he's behind the right hand peak. The red mogul's skin is literally looking clueless trying to figure out what's going on. I've noticed that a tendency that Mr. Savage has is that he makes his opponents kind of sit there behind an open edit. It's because he's doing things so fast and just so differently that it kind of confuses people. That's why I want to show you guys videos just like this where you can use other pros moves so that way you might be able to do the same thing like he's doing. Not only for you guys but for me as well because I need to start doing it. Similar move but in a different way. How many times have you tried the box a player but they end up being on top of the stair? He have edits the stair in the spot that they're on and then he can use that stair as a right hand peak to jump up and shoot them. He did it twice in the same play and then this was the last guy so he was trying to freestyle and do something crazy so he didn't end up going for the final shot but this is still a very viable option for you guys to do in your fight. This is how pros play arena and this is probably how you should be doing it as well. What I noticed Savage doesn't literally every pro. They always try to hop into the box the first few couple seconds the fight starts to happen. Even without the help the advantage and arena I tell people to do this all the time because it wraps up fights super fast but if you do struggle with learning how to jump in the boxes and ending fights quick this is probably the best way to go about it. Constantly trying to jump into the box at the very start of the fight is super super important because people don't know what to expect at the beginning of the fight. Usually how it works if you miss the first time jumping into the box then that player is going to be more defensive and it's going to be harder to jump in the second time. That's why pros who have mastered the jumping into box and just out aiming people get high kill games. That's all because they're really good at getting that first initial jump in on the box. The more you do this this play style of constantly just thinking you're going to have better aim than the other person the way better you're going to be able to get at the game because eventually you're going to learn the mistakes about what went wrong when you tried to jump in the box. After doing that for a long time you're going to realize exactly what you need to fix so that you can do it over and over and over and then you drop 20 bucks. Granite Deplay didn't work here but Savage knows exactly what he's doing. He's very good at making it seem like he's leaving that box. He jumps up off the cone but swings down at a very steep angle to try and wall replace the wall. If you're an average player and this is done to you the person inside the box might think oh he left so they'll stop holding the wall. This is just high IQ when Mr. Savage is playing. A move like this could work even against a very sweaty player. It was a fail and he ends up killing the guy anyway but this just goes to show that he does do this. This clip starts out he pre-fires, he peace controls, he goes crazy and the clip is looking real nice. Towards the end this guy is on his wall kind of spraying with an SMG. He thought that after he reset the wall there's only one wall in there that's not hit so if he could try and claim the peace control to where he thinks the enemy is going to go then he'll wrap up the kill but notice how he does it. He's on the cone and to be honest I never thought about using my walls like this. He jumps up over the cone to drag the walls over and down. That's a really unique way to get a wall on a guy and I think that's pretty optimal but the guy ends up spraying in his face nonetheless still a really good move. Here's a little trick that you might have missed to grab the wall before the other player even thinks about. What Savage does right here is as he's turning the corner he's looking down at a really steep angle. The average player might not be doing this but when you turn corners you kind of want to flick the wall into position. I think I can say that this is a very unique tip to try and grab the wall first before them.\n"

            "REM DATA =  Have you ever gotten third party from the front end the back until the tower Savage is directly in the center of the map. People have eyes on him from everywhere but one thing he does that I've actually seen on the pros do as well. If you're getting shot from two positions instead of trying to spin around and place walls what people will do is place a wall in front of them and then turbo build a stair and a wall at the same time. It's constantly switching between the two builds. This blocks your front and your back but you don't want to sit there and think that it's going to hold forever obviously because bullets bleed through in chapter 3 especially but this is definitely a good way to stop a few bullets from hitting you. It just so happens that the second he tried to edit through the wall the stair broke and he took a lot more damage than expected. This is a move that even against pros will work so so well. He knows that there's a guy above the side jump that he's about to complete. What Savage is really really good at doing is pickaxing walls before anything else before any other builds are placed. He smacks the wall then places a floor and a stair to exploit in on the second pickaxe. This is something that once I saw it I thought oh my god I could do that myself but I never thought about doing it because I've never seen someone do it. Now that I have familiarized myself with it and so have you you should definitely try implementing this into your own game especially if there's a wood wall above that box. It's only two swings to hit and you'll jump right in before they even know what's happening to them. Here's a really good move that I bet a lot of people if you were in Mr. Savage's position right now but what lots of people including myself do sometimes. I'll edit a 50-50 and then place a cone and then just try and shoot the guy pump him and kill him. Mr. Savage attacks his edit by starting out the same way I would. Then instead of placing a cone he ramps the guy off with a stair. This pushes the guy into the back of the box because usually that player is going to be holding the right hand peek so it will always work. After that he doesn't edit but then backs up all the way to place a wall and then he can go for a different peek shot. Personally I think a better edit would be a top right hand corner edit because he did end up taking damage but that initial play of staring people off kind of like stiff orming them into the back of the box. It's definitely something that you should try and practice more often than just placing a cone and running in there with a 50-50. The pressure's on and Mr. Savage is in a box and a guy is pickaxing the only wall that he can escape from. Here's two things that he did super super well and one of those things that people tend to do is they rush it way too much. I've talked a ton about when a player pickaxes your wall. The second they get in front of their wall you can edit the spot where you think they're gonna swing and then you can shoot them as they're swinging. What I've noticed is that pros especially people like Mr. Savage they don't just wait for the guys to be in front of the box. It's almost like they hear the sound of the players swinging their pickaxe and then that's when they confirm the edit. The timing is impeccable. That was the first one. The second thing is that after he shoots the guy what I really like is that he shoots him and then prefires a stair first to block the guy off kind of stiff or I'm back in the box if he just so happened to be there. And then he placed a wall on top of that to try and mongo classic the whole thing and kill the guy quick. So when a guy comes up on your wall try to time it and listen for the pickaxe swing and then make the edit. Then afterwards if there's nothing in front of them try and turbo build a stair and the wall. In Fortnite especially pros are doing this a lot more in their fights. Turbo building two pieces instead of just one. Here's a quick move that lots of people probably know if you're really advanced. If you've been playing this game for a long long time chances are you might know what people tend to do on Fortnite nowadays especially pros when you're fighting them one-on-one. They look to get tons of angles on you but one thing you see is that as the player on high ground Mr. Savage looks for opportunities to place walls one box below him. Then he lands on a flat and then he tries to read where the guy is going but if it just so happens that he's still in front of that box he'll drop down and make a quick edit. What you should do when you're practicing your fights is get used to the building grid by trying to place walls one box below you. This is a great way to establish peace control and sometimes if they're building out of the same material that you place the wall out of they won't even realize that the wall is not there. So if we're both building out a brick and I turbo build a floor below me chances are the guy might not realize it until it's too late. This is some of the moves on Fortnite to definitely keep you up with the chapter 3 meta. Learning unique ways to build, edit, and peace control people it's gonna be one of the fastest ways you can improve at the game but it all starts with familiarizing yourself with just watching the video.

        "txt = \"Welcome guys, this is one of the most anticipated video I ever got whether the iPhone is better or the Android In this video, I'll be comparing iPhone versus Android and we'll be going through the following tests as shown in the screen But for this comparison we'll be using an iPhone 11 2019's flagship versus the OnePlus 9 Pro 2021's flagship here are the specs for the device iPhone 11 has four gigs of RAM while the one plus has 12 gigs of RAM That's three times more and not just that the processor is also better in most scenarios But not by a lot and the iPhone is almost two years old But I'm pretty sure it can still compete against latest flagships because iPhones are very well optimized as compared to Android Let me show you what is optimization by opening the PUBG in both phones at the same time So we'll see which one loads up the game faster by looking at the specs of the devices The OnePlus has better performance so it should load up the game faster and it does complete the loading screen faster in the beginning But as the Android gets closer it's getting slower whereas the iPhone catches up and it even loads up significantly faster than Android. The Android took four seconds longer to load up the game But loading into the lobby screen doesn't matter to most of you So let's check which one will enter into a game faster I will be entering into a cheer park training area which actually takes quite a long time to enter But let's check whether the iPhone will load up faster or the Android So after about ten seconds the iPhone loaded up the game first while the Android is still loading A few moments later Still loading One eternity later So after about 25 seconds the Android finally loaded the game and this is just 2019's iPhone. Latest iPhones will make even bigger difference for example here I have the latest 2021's iPad Pro And it entered into the game within three seconds that's crazy fast While the Android took about 30 seconds to enter into the game So now I hope you understand how good is iPhones optimization Anyway now let's move on to the gyroscope comparison I have played on both iPhone and Android and when using gyroscope I noticed few things The iPhone gyroscope is more responsive or in other words it feels faster as compared to the Android But I actually wanted to show you exactly so I tried to measure or compare iPhones gyro with Android By stacking up both phones on a tripod but it didn't work At the end I found another way to show you the difference So here I have both phones crosshair pointed towards the same thing And I slowly started tilting both phones at the same time I paused the clip here and you can see that iPhones crosshair is slightly higher than Android That's because iPhones gyro is more responsive and it moves faster and quickly Here is another example right now the gyroscope is going downwards And if you look at Android screen it's slightly behind or slower next to the iPhones screen You can also pause the video to check the difference So the iPhones crosshair will reach to the tower first and then later Android's crosshair will reach to the tower So the Android gyro is slightly behind or delayed when compared next to an iPhone But the gyro delay isn't as big as you would notice in Oppo Vivo devices I would guess that iPhones gyro is approximately 10 to 20 milliseconds faster It could be more but I'm assuming it to be around 10 milliseconds Which is really really small difference barely noticeable to many people And another thing that I have notices that iPhones gyro will sink much faster What I mean by that for example when you sit in a chair and play with gyro The gyro will work just fine on both Android and iPhone But when you lay down in bed and play with gyro And Android it sometimes moves in opposite direction or takes some time To sink to your position whereas in iPhones The gyro will work just fine maybe sometimes it rarely happens So overall the iPhones gives a better gyroscope experience Moving on to the next topic, bullet registration Most people say iPhones bullet will register first So I tested this by shooting at almost the same time in the both phones And I ran this test for more than 20 times And the results were the iPhone winning most of the time So is it really true that iPhones bullets will register first? I mean it could be, it's really hard to test that Since iPhones are very well optimized maybe that's why they register faster But the bullet registration totally depends on your internet connection So I have no idea what to say here But there could be another reason And that is the touch registration Here is a fun thing to know iPhone 11 has 120Hz of touch sampling rate While the OnePlus 9 Pro has 240Hz to 360Hz touch sampling rate That's more than twice So technically OnePlus should register the touch first But in reality the iPhone with its slower touch sampling rate will register the touch first Suppose if you touch the fire button on both the OnePlus and iPhone at the same timing The iPhone will fire first Even though the OnePlus's hardware is capable of being two times faster It's not fully utilizing its true power Or simply in other words Android is not optimized Even if they want to optimize it would be extremely hard Because there are more than 1000 phones to be optimized Whereas on iOS there are only few phones And also every phone has a different specification For example ROG5 has 300Hz touch sampling rate And the Red Magic 6 has a 500Hz touch sampling rate And Lenovo Legion 2 Pro has 720Hz touch sampling rate And every phone has a different touch sampling rate So the game developers can't optimize each and every phone Because they can't even fix the bugs and glitches immediately So just like how iPhone's gyroscope is fast and more responsive In the same way the iPhone's touch is more responsive And faster than Android Anyway moving on to the next topic Will iPhones have less recoil than Android? Not really when comparing both recoil patterns from Android And iPhones side by side they look identical Here is the hipfire recoil comparison between Android and iPhone And the hipfire spread will be identical between Android and iPhone I mean the hipfire spread will be totally random every time But it looks identical in terms of recoil But why do people say iPhone has less recoil? Well there is only one explanation I have for that iPhones gyro and touch are very responsive Because of that it feels controlling recoil is easier on iPhone When compared to an Android phone Moving on to the next topic Amosist does iPhones have better Amosist? Well let's find out So here is the side by side comparison of Android and iPhones Amosist And the Amosist is identical in both It performs in the same way between Android and iPhone But why do people say Amosist works better on iPhone? Most people just think that If iPhone is better at few things Then it will be better with other things as well But in reality iPhone has only one advantage and that is optimization And maybe the other reason could be a smoother experience What I mean by that is iPhones will get constant 60 FPS Whereas on Android you do get 60 FPS But it's not stable it always fluctuates and drops a lot of frames And you will notice those frame drops and it's very annoying And it can affect your gaming experience iPhones will provide you with buttery smooth gaming experience So this could be a reason why the people think Amosist and controlling recoil is better in iPhones The only advantage I think Android has over iPhones is that 90 FPS But only few phones will support it And currently the OnePlus 9 Pro doesn't have support to 90 FPS So I have no idea what it's like to play in 90 FPS on Android But as far as I know Most of the player say Android 90 FPS feels like iPhone 60 FPS in terms of smoothness of gameplay But however upcoming iPhones will get 90 FPS option Soon the Android will lose its the only advantage Because Android 90 FPS vs iPhone 90 FPS Is literally like Android 60 FPS vs iPhone 60 FPS So as you know that iPhone will obviously get a constant and stable 90 FPS Whereas the Android always fluctuates between 90 to 50 FPS And now to the graphics comparison So here we have side by side comparison of graphics We have set the same graphics settings on both devices HDR extreme and colorful graphics So now you watch it and find out if there is any differences And let me know in the comments And now if you see the sun's reflection on vehicle doors The iPhone looks really good whereas on Android it looks kind of bad The textures aren't that good as you see on iPhone This could be a screen recording issue or maybe the graphics issues So the graphics looks identical to me But however if you look closer you would notice that iPhone renders houses slightly faster than Android It's like 50 to 100 milliseconds faster on iPhones But both has the same rendering distance and that is around 300 meters So in the final conclusion the iPhones are better than Android when it comes to gaming Especially on PUBG mobile iPhone has better touch response and better gyroscope sensors to get accurate sprays And most importantly stable and constant 60 FPS Which makes your gaming experience buttery smooth However iPhones are very expensive but you're paying for what you're getting Android would last only 2 to 3 years where the iPhones can last up to 6 years If you don't break it an Apple will provide software updates for more than 6 years And it gives you a better experience for everything overall But Android phones are affordable you can get it in any price range Where in iPhones you don't get that choice Anyway that's all I got for this video I hope you learned something new If you did hit the like button and subscribe for more upcoming videos like this And see you guys in the next video enjoy my bot gameplay I am a monster I just need to get it men I need to need The thing that I just painted out when we won't go see See my vision I've been unit I'm a killer I'm a fuckin doll Come in there I'ma play it now I'm a turd dog I'ma play the book I gotta go and get it man, I really just need it Tell these guys they can beat it I'ma get it, I'ma grab it man You never see that, I'ma make it mine I'm explosive like a mine I've been working every time Yeah, I do it on the grind, I'm a shy I'm a shy, yeah I'm be single today I'm a coldest competition Cause some goiss-hoes say Hey, I really go bustin' what's saying Yeah, I guess really ran through the pain But I'm just back at my path And I fixed it now, it's really okay So I ain't gonna waste And my chance to do my time So I'ma be a massive I'ma killin' this is my end, yeah I'm a dumbass Yeah, I am ready to fire I got a million, the sirens They just need to go achieve I just need to acquire So if I've been climbing up this ladder Yeah, some going up higher I need to do it till the day I'm a retire\"\n",
