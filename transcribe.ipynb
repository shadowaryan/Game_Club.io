            "[{'prompt': '', 'completion': \" Welcome guys, so in this video, I will give you 10 tips and tricks for the new Caracan map that you need to know as a pub G player And I hope it will help you to become a better player at this game Starting with the first tip, how to land faster, so usually in other maps you jump out of a plane at 800 meters But in Caracan, you need to make that jump at around 350 meters and then pull your joystick at a 45 degree angle Example like this, in this way, you will reach the maximum diving speed that is 234 kilometers per hour If everything goes right, you will land exactly at your marked location And in Caracan, you get an exclusive new weapon called Panzerfaust It's a one-time use rocket launcher or an explosive weapon extremely powerful and dangerous So in this video, I will tell you how to properly use the Panzerfaust But first you need to understand how powerful it is So the Panzerfaust will kill everyone under 4 meters of its explosive radius Sometimes it can kill even up to 5 meters of its radius So let me show you how much damage does Panzerfaust will deal So it's 0 to 2 meters the enemy will obviously die and at 4 meters the enemy will most likely to die If didn't die, then the enemy will lose 90% of their health and at 6 meters The enemy will lose 60 to 90% of health depending on the explosion and where you hit And at 8 meters, you deal 25% damage And remember this is just approximate values, the real one might deal more damage or less damage, depending on the explosion and situation So how to use the Panzerfaust, it's very simple, but sometimes it could be difficult But you just have to aim really close to the enemy and hit, mostly at the ground since it's more effective And do not aim for the enemy because if they move you will miss your shot, so always aim really close to the enemy and fire And in close range fights, don't be afraid of blowing yourself up because you only lose 25% HP with Panzerfaust explosion But your enemies will die immediately And also when you shoot Panzerfaust at your teammates, your teammates won't die, but they do lose 25% of HP just like you You can use Panzerfaust to shoot accurately up to 150 meters since it has 3 adjustment modes, 60, 100 and 150 meters All you have to do is aim at your enemy and mark the location, which will tell you how far as the target is, then click on the adjust button and adjust according to the distance and then fire The Panzerfaust is a really powerful weapon, it deals damage to targets within 6 meters of the impact point, so when shooting at really far targets you have to be really accurate since you get only one shot The Panzerfaust will spawn around Karakhan at really low rates and as for my experience, it seems to be more common in the hidden areas such as undergrounds and the few hidden buildings where you need to blast your way into to get inside Speaking of undergrounds, the only way you can enter these undergrounds is by a bunker and you need to have a C4 or sticky bomb with you to break into those bunkers Here is a tip about bunkers and always remember this thing, the bunkers with a flag on them will have an underground route so you can enter those But the bunkers with no flag will have no entrance to the underground, they are just bunkers which you can hide inside, but no underground, by the way, here is the location for the biggest underground tunnel, it located right here And another way to find it is to loot an air drop as it is at 100% guaranteed that you will find one Anyway moving on to the next Karakhan exclusive thing is sticky bombs which replaces grenades in this map so you won't find any grenades in Karakhan, you only find the Molotovs and Flash grenades Sticky bombs will deal damage to targets within 4 meters of the impact point Sticky bomb damages is shown here, it will kill everyone under 3 meters of its impact point and if you're at 3.5 meters you will lose around 70% of your HP and if you're at 4 meters, you will lose 25% of your HP and at 5 meters away, the sticky bomb will not deal any damage, its effective range is only up to 4 meters The red zone or the purple zone in Karakhan is a bit different than other one, it's called the Demolition Zone which will destroy some of the buildings randomly inside the red zone So if you find yourself in a red zone on Karakhan, I highly recommend you to get out of the buildings because this red zone will only destroy buildings and if you're inside one of them, you will directly get knocked finished immediately, your teammates won't be able to revive you Even if your building is not completely inside the red zone area, I highly recommend you to get out from that area before it's too late And here is a tactical tip for Karakhan, take those advantages of high grounds, such as buildings and mountains, use the high hills for your advantage, it's harder for the enemies to hit you, especially if you have rocks as your cover And also when doing a rotation or moving to the safe zone, travel from mountain to mountain, never leave the high ground advantage that you have, otherwise you will get stuck at low grounds I'd highly recommend you to go from hill to hill even if it takes longer, never go low hill And the last thing is, there are few walls in Karakhan which can easily be penetrated with gunshots, so be careful hiding behind those walls And also you can destroy the entire walls with a panzer-fost or a sticky bomb Anyway, that's all I got for this video I hope you learned something new, if you did hit the like button and

For example, you have your enemies holding on this exact apartment building while you're on this one, as shown in the video, this is like one of the most common situation in school apartments. Most people usually attack them by going through the stairs which is extremely dangerous because you have no idea where the enemies are camping, that's why using this method will most likely help you to kill them easily. You have to do the following process in order to make that surprise attack, first you need to jump on this rooftop of your enemies apartment in this way. And now go towards the corner of the rooftop as shown here, now you need to jump in order to climb up the small wall of the rooftop's edge example like this. And now look towards the window and then go forward or move your joystick towards the window example like this, there are few things you need to make sure before you do this, you need to stand on this edge of the wall exactly as shown here, otherwise you might fail to enter inside the window. And the next thing, when you move towards the window, you will either slide into the room like this or you will get stuck at outside of the window like this, you just need to hit the climb up to get inside, so I would recommend tapping the climb button when you're close to the window so you'll automatically climb into the room. By the way, this trick works on other sides as well. And similarly you can also do the same thing in open rooftop apartments, while your enemies are rushing from stairs, you can easily surprise attack them. And also if you know there is someone below you, you could throw grenades, it will work extremely good if you properly cook them until timer is at 2-3 seconds. Moving on to the next tip, it's for TDM players, so you most probably aware of this camping spot, or at least got killed more than once from here, so I will show you a grenade lineup that will most likely kill the campers at this spot. To throw the grenade you need to come right at this exact location, and from here, you need to aim for this exact spot with your crosshair, and now jump throw the grenade, if you do it perfectly it will land near the enemy and blows up. Few things you gotta make sure while throwing a grenade is to cook the grenade until the timer reaches 4 seconds, and then when you're jump throwing it, first, release your grenade, or release your finger from the fire button, and then hit the jump button, your grenade will land perfectly near the enemy, and you will get the kill. If you jump and release the grenade at the same time, it may not work, because you have to release the grenade first and then jump. By the way, there is a new arena map, and I have a grenade lineup on this map, usually people camp in this spawn location in this map, so in order to throw the grenade over there, you need to do as followed. So you need to come near this container, and align yourself example like me. Make sure that you're leaning towards right side, and now aim with your crosshair at this spot, and most importantly cook the grenade until timer reaches 3 seconds, and then simply throw it. And the grenade will blow up exactly as it reaches spawn location. This grenade will most likely kill, or damage anyone who are camping at this spawn location. Now to the next tip, this is kind of opposite of first trick, so you're in this school apartment, while your enemies are on this open rooftop apartment. And if you try to throw grenade from here, it's really hard, because if you throw it will either fall off from the apartment or you will get yourself knock while throwing it, so let me show you a safe and best way to throw grenades in this situation. First thing, get on the highest floor, and then go into the specific room, and then climb up the window frame in this way, and yes don't forget to switch to FPP first person. So from here your enemies can't see you and you can't see them, but how can we throw a grenade from here? That's why we rely on certain spots to aim, so you need to place your crosshair at this spot, while throwing the grenade example like this. And cook the grenade until timer reaches really close to two seconds mark, and then throw it, it will blow up right on your enemies rooftop. Cooking the grenade is really important, if you don't cook it properly, then it will most probably go near the stairs area, if you cook it perfectly then it would blow up right in the air at this location. Anyway, that's all I got for this video, I hope you learned something new, if you did hit the like button, and subscribe for more upcoming videos like these, enjoy my bot gameplay, see you guys in the next one. I never say, I'm a fool, to that light, but every time I try to breathe away, kill me, will I love, and I have faith. So I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die, I'll stop that I don't die, just have you die. So I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die, just have you die. I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die, just have you die. When I choose doubt you, I'll just get out of here. I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die, I'll stop that I don't die. So I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die, just have you die. I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die, just have you die.\"}, {'prompt': '', 'completion': \" Welcome guys, so in the new update, we have a new mode called Traverse Insected. You can become an insect in this mode, and also there is a new glitch to get unlimited amount of flare drops. You can get as many as flare drops with this glitch, which I will show you later in this video on how you can get unlimited flare drops. But first let me give you introduction on this new Traverse mode. The first thing you would notice is that there are five new icons in the map, those are labs, or research center, you will get a decent amount of loot here. But currently they are hot drops, so most people will land here, and finding a gun is big challenge, if you're lucky you might get one. And when you're in the lab, there is this machine which is going to make you smaller, you need to get inside of this machine, and then click on the Transform button, now you will transform into a small insect example like this. But sometimes when you click on the transform, it just disappears, if it does disappear for you, then turn off your gyroscope, and now try again, but when you're transforming you need to make sure that you don't move, if you move even slightly it's going to cancel the transformation, so you have to stand still until the transformation is completed. And there is a glitch to get unlimited number of flare ammo, for this you need a flare gun, you don't need the ammo, if you do have it, then drop it on the floor, and now go into the machine, and transform yourself into an insect. And go out from the machine for a second, and get back into the machine, and transform into your normal form, now you will get the flare gun with ammo in it, and you can do this as many times as you can. But sometimes it says excessive use of transformation device places a heavy burden on the body, please try again later, so after about 10 or 20 seconds later, give another try, you will transform into an insect. And then transform back into the normal form, and enjoy the flare drops. By the way, this is a glitch so by the time you're watching this video, this glitch may or may not be working, so it's not 100% guaranteed that this glitch will work, but I will keep it updated in the comment section, and when you turn into an insect, you will get a tiny rocket launcher, or whatever that weapon is called, and you can shoot an unlimited amount of bullets, but it doesn't really deal that much damage when you're shooting a normal human player. It does like 5% damage, and sometimes 10% when you headshot them, so it's kind of useless shooting at normal human players since it doesn't deal good amount of damage. But when you're fighting against other insect players, your rocket launcher will track the enemy, and deals a really good amount of damage, it takes on average two shots to kill them. But the most annoying part is that, shooting at these tiny enemies, or insects is really really hard, I mean I miss all my bullets, because these insects are so tiny, and also I think that aim assist doesn't work on the insects, so it's gonna be even harder to kill the insect player, unless you become one yourself. So I would recommend using explosives such as grenades, as they are more effective to kill the insectoids. And also you can use a gas can explosion to kill insectoids, bait them into coming near a fuel can, and blow it up, it will deal a huge amount of damage to the tiny insects. And also the spawn rate of the pans and labs are very high, so you can use those to hit the insects, and one single hit with a pan will kill the insectoid, so if you are an insectoid stay away as possible from pans, and now to the teleportation, you can teleport through a portal from one lab to another lab, but only possible when you're an insectoid, or tiny insect. And when you become an insect, or insectoid you can collect some dust particles, or the luminator, which you can use them later, to buy stuff from the luminator shop, you can buy armor, health, guns as well as air drop weapons and a lot of stuff. If you go out from the lab while being an insect form, you will see a red zone, it kinda looks similar to blue zone, but it's actually a quantum field, if you cross that area, you will lose your ability to maintain the insectoid form. And after 10 seconds you will turn back into the normal human form, if you're flying too high you might fall down, and die due to the fall damage, so be careful of that. So you gotta remember few things, the lab will stop working, if you're in a blue zone, you can transform yourself into an insectoid north teleport, so the lab stops working in blue zone, and use explosives such as grenades, gas cans are the pan to kill insectoid enemies it's much easier, and lastly the unlimited flare ammo trick, not just works with flare guns, it works with almost any weapon. By the way, follow me on my Instagram, I will be posting short videos on it. Anyway, that's all I got for this video, I hope you learned something new, if you did hit the like button, and subscribe for more upcoming videos like these, see you guys in the next one.\"}, {'prompt': '', 'completion': \" Welcome guys! In this video I will give you 20 amazing tips and tricks that you need to know and they may help you. So let's get started! Moving Vehicle Seat Swap! When you see an enemy while you're driving vehicle, you can swap your seat and star shooting. By doing this, you may lose some of your critical accuracy, but it's still better than jumping from a moving vehicle and losing 80% of health. You may need to be careful while doing this because your vehicle will hit the brake when you swap seats and eventually stops moving, which makes easier for enemies to kill you. So it's better to get down from the vehicle and find a cover. Speaking of cover, you can use your vehicle as cover in some situations. But there's a gap between tires from this gap you can get shots, so it's better to burst the tires and use the vehicle as cover. Now I think you might be safe from getting shots from below the vehicle. This vehicle is still usable, but not as fast as before. And also this depends on vehicles. Make sure you only burst two tires on the same side or it might be tough for you to travel. Or sometimes you don't need to burst the tires, it depends on the situation. You can kill people by shooting from below the object, like a fake car in boot camp, or in military base bridge and many more. This trick works only when legs are visible. So yeah, you should be careful while camping behind objects like these. Do you know that painkillers wait the same amount as the first aid kit in your backpack? Do you think the first aid kit will be much heavier? But the painkiller is quite heavy in your bag. Painkiller is worse boost item in my opinion because it takes up a lot of space in your bag and extremely long to use and also not very efficient. I recommend carrying energy drinks because you can take two energy drinks and it doesn't take as much space in your bag as a painkiller and gives you a little bit more boost than a single painkiller. There are actually two ways of crossing this river near a boot camp, one is from water and another one is using a bridge. You can cross this river by swimming underwater, speaking of underwater you can stay up to 18 to 20 seconds underwater and sometimes you can make it without losing health, sometimes you may lose some health. So swimming underwater is safe and harder for enemies to spot you in water. If you get knocked in the water you'll die instantly, so be careful while traveling from water or while crossing rivers. There is a jump near a boot camp that you can easily do with a bike but with a scooter, maybe you can make halfway through and swim. If you ever made this jump with scooter, then let me know in comments. Most people don't like using a bike because it can easily get flipped but the bike is the fastest vehicle and also a less secured vehicle. You can balance the bike with those up-down controls, so in case if you ever need to use bike use those to control or balance the bike from getting flipped, just like in hill climb racing. Moving while healing is extremely helpful, I think most players know this by now. If you played for more than one season you will get used to moving while healing, it just saves your life if any shots are coming in and make it hard for enemies to shoot at you. And the next tip is for gyroscope players only. Having a different sensitivity for sniping and spraying is really helpful. Change your sensitivity when you want to snip and change it back to normal after. This may be hard at starting, but you'll get used to it. If a bike is about game mechanics, your right peak actually exposes less of your body, then left peak does. It's basically the way the character model works, left peak is going to reveal more of your body means bigger hitbox and more chances of getting hit than if you right peak. And also right peak gives you more field of view, then left peak. You're not saying that never use left peak in certain cases you should do it because it's the only choice, but keep in mind your body exposes a lot when you left peak. Do yourself a favor by having the same weapons in the same slot every time? Let's say you're carrying M4 and a sniper and you have M4 and slot 1 and sniper and slot 2. In that way whenever you want to snipe someone, you will know sniper is in slot 2 and also it gives you muscle memory to understand easier. Whenever you want to spray down enemies from 100 meters or higher, try to use crouch and spray. By crouching your recoil will be reduced a little bit and increases your accuracy. So try to crouch more often to get used to doing it regularly. And if you can't able to control recoil and enemy is so far, then you prone and start shooting, by using prone, your recoil will be reduced almost half, I think so, and it will be harder for enemies to shoot back at you because of smaller hitbox. And maybe sometimes crouching and pruning might be useful in the close range too. You can easily survive all of the zones up to above 5, that's when you should probably think about getting in but when you get stuck in the gun fights in zones like 2, 3 or maybe 4, it's not a good idea of fighting in the blue zone, but with enough health kits and full boost, you can definitely outlive your opponents, there are gonna move or they gonna die under the blue zone. And you could stay safe or at least alive, but by 5th zone, you should be getting in. Whenever you are trying to do the third party to someone, if you see someone not just confirm those kills, you'll get those kills, not the enemy who not them, it's like stealing kills, but worth it because you are getting free kills by stealing their kills. Cooking those nades is probably one of the most important things to learn, however, you want to learn it either going training grounds or count in your head and getting lucky, if I start throwing nades behind that house, those guys will have plenty of time to get away, however, if I cook it perfectly, and this guy will die and not stand a chance of getting out. So do yourself a favor by getting really good at cooking these nades because they make you a better player. And next thing is pre-fire, pre-fire plays an important role whenever you want to push, do it with a pre-fire it always helps and do it more often to get good at it. The more you play the more common hiding spots you know. If you have intel on someone's position you should pre-fire obviously since you are already putting shots down range and the person is still reacting. On defense pre-fire as well, when attackers try to push an object it will make them hesitate or slow down and cancel out their peeker's advantage. If you don't have intel of someone being in a room but you are still clearing it, just quick peek the room look for someone, and if you do see someone pre-fire on the re-peak. Otherwise, just quick peek and pre-aim every angle as you go. I wouldn't worry too much about giving away your position since most people know what's going on without having confirmed intel. Most people check everything anyways. Having more than three smoke grenades will definitely help you in the final circle. When you want to loot a crate during an open battlefield, use smokes. When you want to rush into a building from open ground, use smokes. When you want to make enemies full with a fake grenade, use smokes. So here in my case, I'm rushing in the open field and I use few smokes to give me good a cover and distract them. Try to use the highest sound settings for headphones or earphones, which makes easier for you to listen to enemies footsteps and locate them easily. Gun sounds will be loud at starting, but if you keep on playing on highest sound settings you'll get used to it. And finally having a great game sense, for example, some people who are new to the game will prone in the grass, thinking that they are safe and covered up by all the grass, well they don't understand that grass only renders about few hunters of meters, so my enemy is almost 100 meters away. And he thinks that proning in the grass is safe, but from my angle, I cannot see any grass because it does not render that far. So how to improve your game sense? Well by playing and understanding how game works, the more time you spend on the game, will increase your game sense, and also try to watch some e-sports, which will give you some more details about game sense, and how pro players play.
