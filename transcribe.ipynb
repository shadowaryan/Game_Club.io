            "NOT MORE THAN 2048 TOKEN : DATA  Welcome guys, so in this video, I will give you 10 tips and tricks for the new Caracan map that you need to know as a pub G player And I hope it will help you to become a better player at this game Starting with the first tip, how to land faster, so usually in other maps you jump out of a plane at 800 meters But in Caracan, you need to make that jump at around 350 meters and then pull your joystick at a 45 degree angle Example like this, in this way, you will reach the maximum diving speed that is 234 kilometers per hour If everything goes right, you will land exactly at your marked location And in Caracan, you get an exclusive new weapon called Panzerfaust It's a one-time use rocket launcher or an explosive weapon extremely powerful and dangerous So in this video, I will tell you how to properly use the Panzerfaust But first you need to understand how powerful it is So the Panzerfaust will kill everyone under 4 meters of its explosive radius Sometimes it can kill even up to 5 meters of its radius So let me show you how much damage does Panzerfaust will deal So it's 0 to 2 meters the enemy will obviously die and at 4 meters the enemy will most likely to die If didn't die, then the enemy will lose 90% of their health and at 6 meters The enemy will lose 60 to 90% of health depending on the explosion and where you hit And at 8 meters, you deal 25% damage And remember this is just approximate values, the real one might deal more damage or less damage, depending on the explosion and situation So how to use the Panzerfaust, it's very simple, but sometimes it could be difficult But you just have to aim really close to the enemy and hit, mostly at the ground since it's more effective And do not aim for the enemy because if they move you will miss your shot, so always aim really close to the enemy and fire And in close range fights, don't be afraid of blowing yourself up because you only lose 25% HP with Panzerfaust explosion But your enemies will die immediately And also when you shoot Panzerfaust at your teammates, your teammates won't die, but they do lose 25% of HP just like you You can use Panzerfaust to shoot accurately up to 150 meters since it has 3 adjustment modes, 60, 100 and 150 meters All you have to do is aim at your enemy and mark the location, which will tell you how far as the target is, then click on the adjust button and adjust according to the distance and then fire The Panzerfaust is a really powerful weapon, it deals damage to targets within 6 meters of the impact point, so when shooting at really far targets you have to be really accurate since you get only one shot The Panzerfaust will spawn around Karakhan at really low rates and as for my experience, it seems to be more common in the hidden areas such as undergrounds and the few hidden buildings where you need to blast your way into to get inside Speaking of undergrounds, the only way you can enter these undergrounds is by a bunker and you need to have a C4 or sticky bomb with you to break into those bunkers Here is a tip about bunkers and always remember this thing, the bunkers with a flag on them will have an underground route so you can enter those But the bunkers with no flag will have no entrance to the underground, they are just bunkers which you can hide inside, but no underground, by the way, here is the location for the biggest underground tunnel, it located right here And another way to find it is to loot an air drop as it is at 100% guaranteed that you will find one Anyway moving on to the next Karakhan exclusive thing is sticky bombs which replaces grenades in this map so you won't find any grenades in Karakhan, you only find the Molotovs and Flash grenades Sticky bombs will deal damage to targets within 4 meters of the impact point Sticky bomb damages is shown here, it will kill everyone under 3 meters of its impact point and if you're at 3.5 meters you will lose around 70% of your HP and if you're at 4 meters, you will lose 25% of your HP and at 5 meters away, the sticky bomb will not deal any damage, its effective range is only up to 4 meters The red zone or the purple zone in Karakhan is a bit different than other one, it's called the Demolition Zone which will destroy some of the buildings randomly inside the red zone So if you find yourself in a red zone on Karakhan, I highly recommend you to get out of the buildings because this red zone will only destroy buildings and if you're inside one of them, you will directly get knocked finished immediately, your teammates won't be able to revive you Even if your building is not completely inside the red zone area, I highly recommend you to get out from that area before it's too late And here is a tactical tip for Karakhan, take those advantages of high grounds, such as buildings and mountains, use the high hills for your advantage, it's harder for the enemies to hit you, especially if you have rocks as your cover And also when doing a rotation or moving to the safe zone, travel from mountain to mountain, never leave the high ground advantage that you have, otherwise you will get stuck at low grounds I'd highly recommend you to go from hill to hill even if it takes longer, never go low hill And the last thing is, there are few walls in Karakhan which can easily be penetrated with gunshots, so be careful hiding behind those walls And also you can destroy the entire walls with a panzer-fost or a sticky bomb Anyway, that's all I got for this video I hope you learned something new, if you did hit the like button and

            "NOT MORE THAN 2048 TOKEN : DATA  Welcome guys, in this video I will show you top five amazing tips and tricks that you need to know as a PUBG player and I hope it helps you to become a better player at this game, starting with the first one in school apartments, so this trick is to surprise attack your enemies who are in this exact same apartment building. For example, you have your enemies holding on this exact apartment building while you're on this one, as shown in the video, this is like one of the most common situation in school apartments. Most people usually attack them by going through the stairs which is extremely dangerous because you have no idea where the enemies are camping, that's why using this method will most likely help you to kill them easily. You have to do the following process in order to make that surprise attack, first you need to jump on this rooftop of your enemies apartment in this way. And now go towards the corner of the rooftop as shown here, now you need to jump in order to climb up the small wall of the rooftop's edge example like this. And now look towards the window and then go forward or move your joystick towards the window example like this, there are few things you need to make sure before you do this, you need to stand on this edge of the wall exactly as shown here, otherwise you might fail to enter inside the window. And the next thing, when you move towards the window, you will either slide into the room like this or you will get stuck at outside of the window like this, you just need to hit the climb up to get inside, so I would recommend tapping the climb button when you're close to the window so you'll automatically climb into the room. By the way, this trick works on other sides as well. And similarly you can also do the same thing in open rooftop apartments, while your enemies are rushing from stairs, you can easily surprise attack them. And also if you know there is someone below you, you could throw grenades, it will work extremely good if you properly cook them until timer is at 2-3 seconds. Moving on to the next tip, it's for TDM players, so you most probably aware of this camping spot, or at least got killed more than once from here, so I will show you a grenade lineup that will most likely kill the campers at this spot. To throw the grenade you need to come right at this exact location, and from here, you need to aim for this exact spot with your crosshair, and now jump throw the grenade, if you do it perfectly it will land near the enemy and blows up. Few things you gotta make sure while throwing a grenade is to cook the grenade until the timer reaches 4 seconds, and then when you're jump throwing it, first, release your grenade, or release your finger from the fire button, and then hit the jump button, your grenade will land perfectly near the enemy, and you will get the kill. If you jump and release the grenade at the same time, it may not work, because you have to release the grenade first and then jump. By the way, there is a new arena map, and I have a grenade lineup on this map, usually people camp in this spawn location in this map, so in order to throw the grenade over there, you need to do as followed. So you need to come near this container, and align yourself example like me. Make sure that you're leaning towards right side, and now aim with your crosshair at this spot, and most importantly cook the grenade until timer reaches 3 seconds, and then simply throw it. And the grenade will blow up exactly as it reaches spawn location. This grenade will most likely kill, or damage anyone who are camping at this spawn location. Now to the next tip, this is kind of opposite of first trick, so you're in this school apartment, while your enemies are on this open rooftop apartment. And if you try to throw grenade from here, it's really hard, because if you throw it will either fall off from the apartment or you will get yourself knock while throwing it, so let me show you a safe and best way to throw grenades in this situation. First thing, get on the highest floor, and then go into the specific room, and then climb up the window frame in this way, and yes don't forget to switch to FPP first person. So from here your enemies can't see you and you can't see them, but how can we throw a grenade from here? That's why we rely on certain spots to aim, so you need to place your crosshair at this spot, while throwing the grenade example like this. And cook the grenade until timer reaches really close to two seconds mark, and then throw it, it will blow up right on your enemies rooftop. Cooking the grenade is really important, if you don't cook it properly, then it will most probably go near the stairs area, if you cook it perfectly then it would blow up right in the air at this location. Anyway, that's all I got for this video, I hope you learned something new, if you did hit the like button, and subscribe for more upcoming videos like these, enjoy my bot gameplay, see you guys in the next one. I never say, I'm a fool, to that light, but every time I try to breathe away, kill me, will I love, and I have faith. So I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die, I'll stop that I don't die, just have you die. So I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die, just have you die. I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die, just have you die. When I choose doubt you, I'll just get out of here. I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die, I'll stop that I don't die. So I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die, just have you die. Not to leave peace. I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die. Watch out.\n"

            "NOT MORE THAN 2048 TOKEN : DATA  Welcome guys, so in the new update, we have a new mode called Traverse Insected. You can become an insect in this mode, and also there is a new glitch to get unlimited amount of flare drops. You can get as many as flare drops with this glitch, which I will show you later in this video on how you can get unlimited flare drops. But first let me give you introduction on this new Traverse mode. The first thing you would notice is that there are five new icons in the map, those are labs, or research center, you will get a decent amount of loot here. But currently they are hot drops, so most people will land here, and finding a gun is big challenge, if you're lucky you might get one. And when you're in the lab, there is this machine which is going to make you smaller, you need to get inside of this machine, and then click on the Transform button, now you will transform into a small insect example like this. But sometimes when you click on the transform, it just disappears, if it does disappear for you, then turn off your gyroscope, and now try again, but when you're transforming you need to make sure that you don't move, if you move even slightly it's going to cancel the transformation, so you have to stand still until the transformation is completed. And there is a glitch to get unlimited number of flare ammo, for this you need a flare gun, you don't need the ammo, if you do have it, then drop it on the floor, and now go into the machine, and transform yourself into an insect. And go out from the machine for a second, and get back into the machine, and transform into your normal form, now you will get the flare gun with ammo in it, and you can do this as many times as you can. But sometimes it says excessive use of transformation device places a heavy burden on the body, please try again later, so after about 10 or 20 seconds later, give another try, you will transform into an insect. And then transform back into the normal form, and enjoy the flare drops. By the way, this is a glitch so by the time you're watching this video, this glitch may or may not be working, so it's not 100% guaranteed that this glitch will work, but I will keep it updated in the comment section, and when you turn into an insect, you will get a tiny rocket launcher, or whatever that weapon is called, and you can shoot an unlimited amount of bullets, but it doesn't really deal that much damage when you're shooting a normal human player. It does like 5% damage, and sometimes 10% when you headshot them, so it's kind of useless shooting at normal human players since it doesn't deal good amount of damage. But when you're fighting against other insect players, your rocket launcher will track the enemy, and deals a really good amount of damage, it takes on average two shots to kill them. But the most annoying part is that, shooting at these tiny enemies, or insects is really really hard, I mean I miss all my bullets, because these insects are so tiny, and also I think that aim assist doesn't work on the insects, so it's gonna be even harder to kill the insect player, unless you become one yourself. So I would recommend using explosives such as grenades, as they are more effective to kill the insectoids. And also you can use a gas can explosion to kill insectoids, bait them into coming near a fuel can, and blow it up, it will deal a huge amount of damage to the tiny insects. And also the spawn rate of the pans and labs are very high, so you can use those to hit the insects, and one single hit with a pan will kill the insectoid, so if you are an insectoid stay away as possible from pans, and now to the teleportation, you can teleport through a portal from one lab to another lab, but only possible when you're an insectoid, or tiny insect. And when you become an insect, or insectoid you can collect some dust particles, or the luminator, which you can use them later, to buy stuff from the luminator shop, you can buy armor, health, guns as well as air drop weapons and a lot of stuff. If you go out from the lab while being an insect form, you will see a red zone, it kinda looks similar to blue zone, but it's actually a quantum field, if you cross that area, you will lose your ability to maintain the insectoid form. And after 10 seconds you will turn back into the normal human form, if you're flying too high you might fall down, and die due to the fall damage, so be careful of that. So you gotta remember few things, the lab will stop working, if you're in a blue zone, you can transform yourself into an insectoid north teleport, so the lab stops working in blue zone, and use explosives such as grenades, gas cans are the pan to kill insectoid enemies it's much easier, and lastly the unlimited flare ammo trick, not just works with flare guns, it works with almost any weapon. By the way, follow me on my Instagram, I will be posting short videos on it. Anyway, that's all I got for this video, I hope you learned something new, if you did hit the like button, and subscribe for more upcoming videos like these, see you guys in the next one.\n"

            "NOT MORE THAN 2048 TOKEN : DATA  Welcome guys! In this video I will give you 20 amazing tips and tricks that you need to know and they may help you. So let's get started! Moving Vehicle Seat Swap! When you see an enemy while you're driving vehicle, you can swap your seat and star shooting. By doing this, you may lose some of your critical accuracy, but it's still better than jumping from a moving vehicle and losing 80% of health. You may need to be careful while doing this because your vehicle will hit the brake when you swap seats and eventually stops moving, which makes easier for enemies to kill you. So it's better to get down from the vehicle and find a cover. Speaking of cover, you can use your vehicle as cover in some situations. But there's a gap between tires from this gap you can get shots, so it's better to burst the tires and use the vehicle as cover. Now I think you might be safe from getting shots from below the vehicle. This vehicle is still usable, but not as fast as before. And also this depends on vehicles. Make sure you only burst two tires on the same side or it might be tough for you to travel. Or sometimes you don't need to burst the tires, it depends on the situation. You can kill people by shooting from below the object, like a fake car in boot camp, or in military base bridge and many more. This trick works only when legs are visible. So yeah, you should be careful while camping behind objects like these. Do you know that painkillers wait the same amount as the first aid kit in your backpack? Do you think the first aid kit will be much heavier? But the painkiller is quite heavy in your bag. Painkiller is worse boost item in my opinion because it takes up a lot of space in your bag and extremely long to use and also not very efficient. I recommend carrying energy drinks because you can take two energy drinks and it doesn't take as much space in your bag as a painkiller and gives you a little bit more boost than a single painkiller. There are actually two ways of crossing this river near a boot camp, one is from water and another one is using a bridge. You can cross this river by swimming underwater, speaking of underwater you can stay up to 18 to 20 seconds underwater and sometimes you can make it without losing health, sometimes you may lose some health. So swimming underwater is safe and harder for enemies to spot you in water. If you get knocked in the water you'll die instantly, so be careful while traveling from water or while crossing rivers. There is a jump near a boot camp that you can easily do with a bike but with a scooter, maybe you can make halfway through and swim. If you ever made this jump with scooter, then let me know in comments. Most people don't like using a bike because it can easily get flipped but the bike is the fastest vehicle and also a less secured vehicle. You can balance the bike with those up-down controls, so in case if you ever need to use bike use those to control or balance the bike from getting flipped, just like in hill climb racing. Moving while healing is extremely helpful, I think most players know this by now. If you played for more than one season you will get used to moving while healing, it just saves your life if any shots are coming in and make it hard for enemies to shoot at you. And the next tip is for gyroscope players only. Having a different sensitivity for sniping and spraying is really helpful. Change your sensitivity when you want to snip and change it back to normal after. This may be hard at starting, but you'll get used to it. If a bike is about game mechanics, your right peak actually exposes less of your body, then left peak does. It's basically the way the character model works, left peak is going to reveal more of your body means bigger hitbox and more chances of getting hit than if you right peak. And also right peak gives you more field of view, then left peak. You're not saying that never use left peak in certain cases you should do it because it's the only choice, but keep in mind your body exposes a lot when you left peak. Do yourself a favor by having the same weapons in the same slot every time? Let's say you're carrying M4 and a sniper and you have M4 and slot 1 and sniper and slot 2. In that way whenever you want to snipe someone, you will know sniper is in slot 2 and also it gives you muscle memory to understand easier. Whenever you want to spray down enemies from 100 meters or higher, try to use crouch and spray. By crouching your recoil will be reduced a little bit and increases your accuracy. So try to crouch more often to get used to doing it regularly. And if you can't able to control recoil and enemy is so far, then you prone and start shooting, by using prone, your recoil will be reduced almost half, I think so, and it will be harder for enemies to shoot back at you because of smaller hitbox. And maybe sometimes crouching and pruning might be useful in the close range too. You can easily survive all of the zones up to above 5, that's when you should probably think about getting in but when you get stuck in the gun fights in zones like 2, 3 or maybe 4, it's not a good idea of fighting in the blue zone, but with enough health kits and full boost, you can definitely outlive your opponents, there are gonna move or they gonna die under the blue zone. And you could stay safe or at least alive, but by 5th zone, you should be getting in. Whenever you are trying to do the third party to someone, if you see someone not just confirm those kills, you'll get those kills, not the enemy who not them, it's like stealing kills, but worth it because you are getting free kills by stealing their kills. Cooking those nades is probably one of the most important things to learn, however, you want to learn it either going training grounds or count in your head and getting lucky, if I start throwing nades behind that house, those guys will have plenty of time to get away, however, if I cook it perfectly, and this guy will die and not stand a chance of getting out. So do yourself a favor by getting really good at cooking these nades because they make you a better player. And next thing is pre-fire, pre-fire plays an important role whenever you want to push, do it with a pre-fire it always helps and do it more often to get good at it. The more you play the more common hiding spots you know. If you have intel on someone's position you should pre-fire obviously since you are already putting shots down range and the person is still reacting. On defense pre-fire as well, when attackers try to push an object it will make them hesitate or slow down and cancel out their peeker's advantage. If you don't have intel of someone being in a room but you are still clearing it, just quick peek the room look for someone, and if you do see someone pre-fire on the re-peak. Otherwise, just quick peek and pre-aim every angle as you go. I wouldn't worry too much about giving away your position since most people know what's going on without having confirmed intel. Most people check everything anyways. Having more than three smoke grenades will definitely help you in the final circle. When you want to loot a crate during an open battlefield, use smokes. When you want to rush into a building from open ground, use smokes. When you want to make enemies full with a fake grenade, use smokes. So here in my case, I'm rushing in the open field and I use few smokes to give me good a cover and distract them. Try to use the highest sound settings for headphones or earphones, which makes easier for you to listen to enemies footsteps and locate them easily. Gun sounds will be loud at starting, but if you keep on playing on highest sound settings you'll get used to it. And finally having a great game sense, for example, some people who are new to the game will prone in the grass, thinking that they are safe and covered up by all the grass, well they don't understand that grass only renders about few hunters of meters, so my enemy is almost 100 meters away. And he thinks that proning in the grass is safe, but from my angle, I cannot see any grass because it does not render that far. So how to improve your game sense? Well by playing and understanding how game works, the more time you spend on the game, will increase your game sense, and also try to watch some e-sports, which will give you some more details about game sense, and how pro players play. So yeah, that's it for this video.

typing your friend's name or character ID in this search bar.\", \" You can then invite those friends into your party using this button, but if you don't have any friends, the game will automatically select teammates for you.\", ' Joining a clan is a great way to find friends and forming a crew makes it easy to find your closest friends quickly.', \" After you've played a few games, I recommend spending some time in the armory.\", ' The armory lets you see the stats on every single gun in the game and how that gun interacts with the various mods you can find for it.', ' This is incredibly helpful for knowing which gun you want to keep on the battlefield.', \" If you're free to play gamer, there are only two parts of the shop that apply to you.\", ' First one is the soldier crate.', ' You can be bought for battle points which you get from logging in and playing the game.', ' Missions for getting these points are either reset daily or weekly on Sunday at 6pm central standard time, which is also when the soldier crate price resets.', ' The second one is the redeemed section.', ' These items can be bought with the tokens you get for dismantling clothing duplicates.', ' If you are not a free to play player, the best way to support the devs is to buy one of these elite season passes because they offer more rewards per dollar than any other offer.', ' All of these other tabs are either not important at all or you will see a red dot when they do become important.', ' So when you have everything set up the way you want it, click start.', \" If you're playing on a team, the most important thing you can do is communicate with your teammates.\", ' In addition to an in game chat system, PUBG has implemented several ways to help a team communicate and work together.', ' The first way is accessible by clicking on the mini map, this will pull up a bigger map.', ' By clicking anywhere on this map, it will automatically set a marker that you and your teammates can see.', ' This is helpful for a lot of reasons, but the most common thing this is used for is telling your teammates where you want to go.', ' You can also click on this tab here which allows you to follow a teammate or invite them to follow you.', ' This makes it really easy for your team to end up in the same place and reduces your chance of miscommunication.', ' Lastly, if you do not want to use the voice chat, you can click the dialog button here, which gives you a ton of communication options.', ' Some of these options have further meaning based on what you are pointing at when you use them.', \" These in vehicles on the map are randomized each time you play, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't pay attention to where you got something, because certain places are more likely to give better weapons than others.\", ' If you get really familiar with an area, you will have a huge upper hand on someone that is just wandering around aimlessly.', ' As a general rule, these areas have more and better loot, but most players know that, so they tend to be more heavily sought after.', ' If you are playing a solo game, I strongly recommend avoiding these places if they are close to where the plane enters the map.', ' All of the players are in the exact same plane as you, and most players have a tendency to exit the plane earlier.', ' You can see which players have exited the plane by this number right here.', ' If you are a confident player, I recommend finding one of these good locations that is off the path and marking it on your map.', ' The maximum distance you can travel after jumping out of the plane is around 1500 meters.', ' Some players will tell you that you can extend this distance by opening up your parachute early or slowing down your movement speed, but this is not true for PUBG Mobile, and using this approach just delays how fast you get weapons.', ' If you are a less confident player, I recommend doing the same thing with one of these smaller groups of buildings that is off the path.', ' There is no inertia in the game, so as soon as you jump off the plane, you can travel the opposite way of the plane just as far as if you were going with it.', \" But I don't recommend doing that because other players that got off the plane earlier will get to the same destination faster than you, which means they will probably have guns by the time you land.\", ' As I mentioned earlier, the items are randomized, but if you find a location that has a lot of great stuff, it will probably have a lot of great stuff every time you go there.', \" So if you are pretty new to the game, I recommend going to the same place as much as you can to get really familiar with it, which will give you a huge advantage over other players that aren't as familiar with that area.\", ' After the plane leaves the island, a safe zone will appear.', ' It will be a circle covering about a third of the island, and a timer will start with 5 minutes.', ' When this timer runs out, a radiation zone will start closing in on that circle.', ' The radiation zone wall moves slower or faster, based on how far it is to the closest edge of the new circle.', ' This means that if you are far away from the circle, the radiation zone travels significantly faster than you can run.', ' The process of the radiation zone shrinking the first time also takes exactly 5 minutes.', ' At this point, a new safe zone appears, and the process repeats itself for a total of 9 phases.', ' Here are the main stats on each of these phases.', ' For those of you who have been playing for a while, these numbers may not seem that important, but now that you know them, you will be surprised how often this knowledge will affect your decisions.', ' Knowing details about what is going on around you in a game can often increase confidence and reduce indecisiveness.', \" In the beginning, you don't have to worry that much about the radiation zone because it only does 0.\", '4 damage per second.', ' But this damage increases each round, so by the time you get to the end of the game, the radiation zone does 11 damage per second, which makes it incredibly important to be in the safe zone.', ' For those of you who are used to playing rules of survival where you can spend the first half of the game in the radiation zone, you will find this much more difficult to do in PUBG.', ' As soon as you land, find a gun with ammo as quickly as possible.', \" People can tell when you don't have a gun and they will chase you mercilessly until you are dead.\", ' Once you have a gun, I recommend searching for a rifle and ammo.', ' SMGs are a much better option than they were in rules of survival, but having a rifle is one of your weapons is still really important.', ' Even what your average bullet per kill ratio is, and then unless you have a really nice backpack stop gathering ammo after you have enough to kill 8 people.', \" I promise that by the time you've killed those 8 people you will have found more ammo.\", \" If you see the shooting icon, don't assume they're shooting at you, but look around to see if you can find them.\", \" If you see them and they don't see you, don't attack them unless it's an easy kill.\", ' Long battles attract a lot of attention and should be avoided.', \" Stay near buildings so that if you start taking damage and you don't see them, you can just run around a corner to buy you some time and set up if they chase you.\", \" Now if you're still in bronze, most of the players you will be fighting are AI players, which are really easy to kill.\", ' Do not let this easy competition make you develop bad habits.', \" Try to always fight from a position where you have cover and if you don't have cover, try to get in the habit of moving while you shoot so that you do not become an easy target.\", \" Even if the player you're shooting does not see you start moving within 2 seconds after first firing your gun because if you shoot at someone while you are not in cover, it will likely attract the attention of someone else nearby and standing in the middle of the field will get you killed really quickly.\", \" So get in the habit of moving while you shoot every time you engage when you don't have cover to hide behind.\", \" If you're playing a team game, the most important thing you can do in the very early stage is stay close enough to your teammates so that you can support each other while you're looking for items.\", \" If you're playing competitively then you should have a good team and if you have a good team, then you should live or die as a team.\", \" Playing 3 vs 4 in a competitive game is stupid, especially because it's so easy to avoid.\", ' You also want to be on the lookout for good armor, helmets and backpacks.', ' Level 3 items are the best in the game but they are also rare.', \" Level 2 items are attainable but don't spend too much time trying to get all level 2 pieces.\", ' You can see what level your gear is from how many bars are here.', ' Once you have some decent gear, you have several options on what to do next.', ' PUBG is a multifaceted game.', ' You get points for killing people, doing damage, getting supplies, surviving the longest and even get points for taking damage and then healing yourself.', ' This gives you lots of options on how to play this game.', ' If you want to know the 4 main strategies for how people play PUBG, I recommend checking out my video that lays out the pros and cons of all 4 of them.', \" The only tactic that I don't mention in that video is the car rampage tactic.\", ' Using a car is your weapon is very effective.', ' So much so that there are some players that are able to win solo games without ever shooting a gun.', \" That tactic is a great option as is all the tactics I mentioned in that video and if you're going for points you should do whichever one best fits your strengths as a player.\", \" But in this video I'm going to be focusing on how to get first place.\", ' PUBG is not just a shooter game.', ' You can be fun to play it that way and you still get lots of points doing it but if you want to get first place often you have to get out of that mentality.', ' PUBG is also a survival game.', ' Shooting a gun attracts attention and attention is a great way to die.', \" If I see someone and they don't see me but I'm not in a good enough position to kill them and take on someone else that hears me kill them I just let them go.\", \" In fact if I'm really playing competitive like I'm trying to get first place every time I often just watch people for most of the game and only kill when I really have a good read on where everyone is at.\", ' The best place to hide is in tall grass on high ground near a rock or tree.', \" For those of you who saw my rules of survival video my tactic where I hide in one of these little sheds with a shotgun is not nearly as effective in PUBG because it's not as easy to one shot someone so I seldom use this tactic when I'm playing PUBG.\", \" I still love using shotguns and I see a lot of pros use them in urban combat but I don't use the shed tactic.\", \" Now when you're part of a team there's no reason to hide because a well-positioned team that works well together can kill dozens of players without ever receiving a single casualty.\", ' The team simply has to make sure that they position themselves in a place that they can fight in any direction with little to moderate repositioning.', ' They also need to make sure that they are close enough to each other that they can revive downed enemies without being exposed.', ' The team that works well together under those conditions is almost invincible.', ' A solo person however is not especially in PUBG.', \" A lot of players are really good with a car 98 so drawing too much attention can be the end even if you're a really good player.\", ' If you are pushing hard for the first place position I recommend using one of these two tactics.', ' If you find that you are already in the new safe zone when it appears I recommend staying in your hiding place for as long as you can.', \" Look around to see where people are but don't kill anyone unless you are confident that you can kill them within 2 seconds of first firing your gun.\", ' Look at them if they are close but be super wary of other enemies since you just fired your gun.', ' Even firing a gun with a suppressor will still alert enemies if they are close enough.', ' In a team game if you shoot someone and they die without getting knocked down first then that means that all of their teammates are already dead.', ' But if they get knocked down first instead of dying that means that at least one of their teammates is still alive and the guy you just knocked down can communicate your position to his teammates even after you kill him.', \" So you want to kill him as soon as possible so his teammates don't revive him but you also want to be cautious when it happens and stick close to your teammates.\", ' It is incredibly hard for someone to see you when you are crawling in the grass if you are on high ground.', ' But if you are on lower ground than them high grass is almost worthless.', ' If you are on high ground and stay still people should not be able to see you unless you are within 7 meters or closer.', ' If you find yourself outside of the new safe zone when it appears I recommend waiting as long as possible.', ' You can run from cover to cover if you are careful to look around while you do it but I recommend giving other players a chance to get to the safe zone first.', ' This might seem like horrible advice because a lot of players talk about killing people as they run to the safe zone but once you try it a couple times you will notice that that happens rarely.', ' In PUBG most players die when an enemy notices them first.', ' That enemy then fires at them when they are in bad position and they have very little chance of winning the fight.', ' By letting other players go first you will find that you often see other players before they see you.', ' In fact most of them will never see you because their back is turned to you most of the time as they run to safety.', ' Usually by the end everyone is calling around at a field and behind cover and it is very hard to see them.', ' If you are part of a team and there are no buildings in the safe zone I recommend spreading out about 4 to 8 meters from each other.', ' This makes you close enough to support each other but far enough away that enemies will probably only see one of you at a time.', ' If you are playing solo stay hidden as long as possible.', ' Remember this tutorial is about getting first place so ideally you only have to kill one person to win but the closer you get to the end the harder it is to not run into someone.', ' When you see someone get close kill them while you still have the advantage of shooting first then slowly crawl away from your kill while looking around because the loot box is noticeable from a distance and your enemies will likely be looking for you to loot your kill.', ' When you are down to the last two the safe zone is usually pretty small right now.', ' I am not very good at throwing grenades so I have usually saved up about 5 or more grenades at this point.', ' If you see the other guy but they are in cover chunk all of your grenades at them.', \" Remember to wait a second or two before throwing it so they don't have as much time to run away but obviously don't wait 3 seconds or you will be giving them an easy win.\", ' Even the more likely scenario you do not see them but the safe zone is very small I recommend throwing one of your grenades at every tree and rock that is in the safe zone.', ' This is kind of a controversial tactic because if they are close enough they can hear you pull the pin on your grenade and if they are watching they will either see you or the grenade in the air which will let them get an idea for where you are at.', ' And I agree with those objections in theory but in practice I find that this tactic almost always works out to your favorite because the grenades usually get people to come out of their cover or reveal where they are and I only do this when I have a really good position.', \" So in my experience it either works or they weren't in cover because they were crawling on the grass and it doesn't seem to have an effect either way.\", ' So I recommend trying it out for yourself and see if you can land the first place spot.', ' In addition to those 99 tips and tricks I have 52 more for you.', ' There seems to be a lot of confusion even among advanced players on how boost items work.', ' I hear a lot of people say that energy drinks give you movement speed but painkillers do not.', ' That is not true.', ' Energy items do not give you any benefits in and of themselves.', ' Rather they give you points towards your boost meter and your boost meter gives you benefits.', \" It's important to think this way because if you don't you will get confused.\", ' There are very advanced websites out there that say things like energy drinks will restore 23% of your health.', ' That is not true.', ' If you use an energy drink well it can heal up to 52% of your health.', \" Here's how the boost system works.\", ' When you use a boost item it gives you a percentage of your boost meter which diminishes over time.', ' This meter consists of a total of 5 minutes.', ' Energy drinks give you 40% of that meter which is equal to 2 minutes.', ' Energy drinks will give you 60% which is equal to 3 minutes and the adrenaline syringe gives you 100% which covers the whole 5 minutes.', ' You get different benefits based on how much boost you have in your boost meter.', ' So using an energy drink by itself actually only heals 22% of your health.', ' But that is not the best way to use an energy drink.', ' If you use a painkiller and then an energy drink that same energy drink will heal 52% of your health and give you a move in speed bonus of either 2.', '5 or 6.', '2% based on which bar you are on.', ' And then after 2 minutes when your bar drops back down to 60%.', ' You can use another energy drink to get another 52% of your health back and have another move in speed bonus.', \" So that's how the boost system works in PUBG.\", ' If you want to know more about my strategy on how to maximize this system to your advantage be sure to check out my video titled How to get double healing from energy drinks.', ' To just recently added the flare gun into the game you need to aim towards the sky in order to use it.', ' Using it outside the safe zone will spawn an armored vehicle and using it inside the safe zone will spawn a special air drop with twice the normal loot.', ' The developers never actually added infrastructure to these towers so you cannot land on them no matter how hard you try.', ' But there is a way to use the lean function to get a little bit up this tower.', ' While clearing a house or going around a corner you can use your third person camera to peek around the other side which is an effective way to stay safe while scouting.', ' While driving a vehicle you can see its health and fuel bar shown here.', ' You can also tell when one of your tires has been destroyed because the corresponding icon will turn red.', \" Peek as much as you can even when you're in a house but remember that staying inside a house can sometimes become a death trap if you are up against a player who is skilled with grenades.\", ' While shooting through a window or any small hole you will notice that you do not always shoot where your crosshairs are.', \" Remember to leave more space below your aim so that you don't hit the wall in front of you while you are shooting.\", \" Short grass will actually disappear once you are more than 150 meters away from the grass so don't try to hide in short grass.\", \" Zooming in doesn't just magnify it allows you to see as if you were actually closer.\", \" So some players will appear that weren't previously visible.\", ' Unlike most other shooter games PUBG has implemented a bullet drop for every gun so remember to aim high when trying to shoot longer range shots.', ' Especially on guns that do not have a high range stat.', ' This is again where the armory is particularly helpful.', ' If you unequip all your weapons you can run much faster.', ' If you do this your character will move 6.', \"3 meters per second so that's a good way to measure how long it will take you to reach the safe zone.\", \" If you're too far from the circle try to look for a vehicle.\", ' You can usually find them along roads.', ' You can use downed enemies as bait to get their teammates to come try to revive them but make sure you kill them before they reach cover.', ' I personally like to put all of my guns on single fire mode.', ' I find that the extra headshots more than make up for the slow rate of fire.', ' If the safe zone covers the outer sea you can swim away from the shore and survive a really long time but doing this will probably make it more difficult to get first place because you have to get back to shore before you can fire your gun.', \" You can't heal beyond 75% health level except when you are using med kits, energy drinks, pills or the adrenaline syringe.\", ' While the crossbow and pubg looks awesome and it can one shot an unarmored enemy even with a body shot which can sometimes make it useful in the initial scramble it is actually a terrible weapon.', ' It has a long reloading time and you get one shot at a time.', \" The only thing that's good about this weapon is that it makes absolutely no noise.\", ' Always choose a pan over other melee weapons it has higher damage and it can block bullets.', ' I know this is a tip for doing better at the game but I strongly recommend checking out the Viva Lidert League YouTube channel.', \" I'm pretty busy with work and family and I don't have time to watch a lot of YouTube channels but I watch and like every single pubgie video these guys make and several of their other series.\", ' Just watch this one video from them and then when you fall in love with them remember that JCF was the one that sent you.', \" Smoke grenades are useful for reviving a teammate or repositioning but remember to throw them quite a bit in front of the area that you were trying to cover because they don't cover the area immediately near where they land.\", \" Please pay attention to your mini map even when you're using a scope to see where your enemy is shooting from.\", ' Audio is really important this game since a lot of noises like opening doors, looting, healing, pulling the pen on a grenade, a thrown grenade and most footsteps do not give these notifications.', ' If you are wanting to play competitively I recommend using a good headset so that you not only hear those noises but a good headset will help you identify where those noises are coming from.', ' Here you have full health before getting into a fight and using painkillers and boost right before engaging an enemy is a great way to give yourself an advantage in a fight especially at the end of the game when options are the most limited.', ' Wearing darker clothes like black shirt, black pants etc is best for the main map, airing out but they make you easier to spot in Miramar.', ' Natural colors like yellow and gray are the best if you want to play on that map.', ' Like I said earlier I almost always put my weapons on single shot but this is especially important if you are trying to shoot someone from far away because the recoil of the gun is magnified the further distance you shoot.', ' When you are parachuting down use the eye icon to see how many players and teams are dropping at the same place as you.', \" After you kill someone don't just stand there and loot their body that's a great way to get snipe.\", ' Just grab what you can within one second and then get out.', ' When you get shot at never ever ever start crawling or crouching.', ' This is a very common new mistake.', ' Having and crawling is helpful for hiding behind cover and not getting notice in the first place.', ' They actually make you an easier target because they make you go slower.', ' Always use the left fire button when using a scope because you will need your right thumb to aim.', ' When you want to show your teammate where an enemy is at just move your crosshair over the enemy and then click the enemy ahead dialogue in the chat.', ' Having scopes with higher magnification is always more useful than a lower one but do not equip a six time scope or higher on both of your items or it will severely weaken your close quarter combat.', ' Moving silently in PUBG is a lot more difficult than rules of survival.', \" So if you are playing a solo game I don't recommend staying too long in buildings.\", \" Using the boost option for vehicles requires a lot more gas and creates more noise so I don't recommend using it unless you are getting shot at or trying to outrun the radiation zone.\", ' When there are only two people in a car sit on the same side so the driver can position the car as a shield in combat.', ' While you are swimming pay attention to your lung function.', \" If it is turning red that means the game is thinking that you are still submerged in water even though your character looks like it's not.\", ' Pressing crouch will let you submerge into water and jump will allow you to surface.', ' If you are trying to get to the safe zone or escape an enemy fire by swimming submerging is a great way to increase your safety.', ' Bullets can penetrate water but the damage is significantly reduced.', ' You are also obviously harder to spot when you are underwater.', ' And then lastly if you are pretty new to the game I recommend avoiding motorcycles because they can be pretty difficult to master and it is much easier for other enemies to kill you.', \" Well that's it guys hope that helps.\", ' Obviously compiling that was a lot of work so please remember to like this video if you did in fact like this video and if you liked it a lot can you please share it on your Facebook and Discord groups so that more people can see it.', ' JCF is a pretty new channel and it really helps me grow.', \" Alright guys I'll see you next time.\"]\n"

            "NEW DATA =  J.CF is short for Hugando Conforza, which is Spanish for playing with force, but is also play on words because my character's name is Forza. So I'm playing with Forza. After helping develop the Battle Royale concept for games like Armour and H1Z1, Brendan Green, known by his alias player unknown, was hired as a creative developer at Bluehole to realize his vision for the genre in his game Player Unknown's Battleground, which exploded into and is still currently considered the defining game of the genre, even though later Fortnite used 3-to-play concepts to surpass it in size and income. Today I'm going to give you 151 tips and tricks for PUBG. When you first sign up, you will be given the chance to choose a name and customize a character. A lot of players will tell you that the female character has a smaller hitbox and therefore gives you a tactical advantage, but the developers of the game have clarified that even though the girl character is smaller than the guy, the hitboxes are identical. Upon hearing this, some players will still push back saying that there might be a tactical advantage in choosing a girl because she is smaller and therefore harder to see, but since 99% of finding someone has to do with noise and camouflage levels, which are also identical between genders, these claims are at-fess and significant. After choosing your character, you will be brought to the menu screen. Before getting started, I recommend clicking on the settings button here to customize a few things. On the basic tab, enabling Amuses lets the game move the crosshairs for you a little bit, which I personally like, but it is not always helpful because enemies don't always move in the direction the game anticipates, which in those instances it can actually throw you off. Using the release option on these different firing modes gives you more precision when firing, but it also takes a while to get used to it, so I wouldn't recommend doing that unless you're an advanced player. I strongly recommend enabling peak and fire even if you're a new player because this is something you want to get good at eventually, but I wouldn't recommend selecting the whole to lean unless you're an advanced player. I keep all the other settings in this tab on their default, but it is important to note that auto-open doors can cause you to accidentally open a door at the wrong time, alerting nearby enemies to your location. In the graphics tab, setting the style the colorful will increase contrast and make it easier to see other players, and selecting a high frame rate will give your reaction time a slight advantage. This makes graphics the least important setting in this tab so it just it based on what your phone can handle. Since I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S7, which is becoming an older phone, I keep my graphics on the lowest possible setting and I keep all the other settings on default. In the controls tab, I recommend clicking the Customize button and adjusting your peak and fire buttons to be a little bit closer so you don't have to extend your thumb so far. I also recommend reducing the distance of the sprint button just a little bit and moving all of these buttons here on the right just a little bit closer to each other. Those are my favorite settings, but ultimately you need to find what works best for you. If you want to experiment with something, I recommend first trying it out in a new layout so that you can revert back to your old customized settings if you don't like it. You'll notice in my third layout that I have my shooting buttons at the top of my screen, because I bought these cool little trigger things for three bucks online from some company in China. I'm still getting the hang of them, but once I figure them out, I think having those two extra fingers will be a game changer. So if you want to try them, I'll put links to where to buy them in the description. I recommend disabling auto pickup because once you know what you're doing, it usually slows you down or crowds up your inventory. I keep all the settings on the other tabs at their default, but after you've been playing for a while, you might want to browse through them to see if you want to adjust anything. Now that we've talked about settings, let me touch briefly on the menu screen. You can customize all your game settings here, including perspective, server, modes, maps, teams, etc. Whatever you set here will be remembered and you will use those settings every time you click start. You can add friends by clicking on this button and then selecting the Add Friend tab and then typing your friend's name or character ID in this search bar. You can then invite those friends into your party using this button, but if you don't have any friends, the game will automatically select teammates for you. Joining a clan is a great way to find friends and forming a crew makes it easy to find your closest friends quickly. After you've played a few games, I recommend spending some time in the armory. The armory lets you see the stats on every single gun in the game and how that gun interacts with the various mods you can find for it. This is incredibly helpful for knowing which gun you want to keep on the battlefield. If you're free to play gamer, there are only two parts of the shop that apply to you. First one is the soldier crate. You can be bought for battle points which you get from logging in and playing the game. Missions for getting these points are either reset daily or weekly on Sunday at 6pm central standard time, which is also when the soldier crate price resets. The second one is the redeemed section. These items can be bought with the tokens you get for dismantling clothing duplicates. If you are not a free to play player, the best way to support the devs is to buy one of these elite season passes because they offer more rewards per dollar than any other offer. All of these other tabs are either not important at all or you will see a red dot when they do become important. So when you have everything set up the way you want it, click start. If you're playing on a team, the most important thing you can do is communicate with your teammates. In addition to an in game chat system, PUBG has implemented several ways to help a team communicate and work together. The first way is accessible by clicking on the mini map, this will pull up a bigger map. By clicking anywhere on this map, it will automatically set a marker that you and your teammates can see. This is helpful for a lot of reasons, but the most common thing this is used for is telling your teammates where you want to go. You can also click on this tab here which allows you to follow a teammate or invite them to follow you. This makes it really easy for your team to end up in the same place and reduces your chance of miscommunication. Lastly, if you do not want to use the voice chat, you can click the dialog button here, which gives you a ton of communication options. Some of these options have further meaning based on what you are pointing at when you use them. These in vehicles on the map are randomized each time you play, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't pay attention to where you got something, because certain places are more likely to give better weapons than others. If you get really familiar with an area, you will have a huge upper hand on someone that is just wandering around aimlessly. As a general rule, these areas have more and better loot, but most players know that, so they tend to be more heavily sought after. If you are playing a solo game, I strongly recommend avoiding these places if they are close to where the plane enters the map. All of the players are in the exact same plane as you, and most players have a tendency to exit the plane earlier. You can see which players have exited the plane by this number right here. If you are a confident player, I recommend finding one of these good locations that is off the path and marking it on your map. The maximum distance you can travel after jumping out of the plane is around 1500 meters. Some players will tell you that you can extend this distance by opening up your parachute early or slowing down your movement speed, but this is not true for PUBG Mobile, and using this approach just delays how fast you get weapons. If you are a less confident player, I recommend doing the same thing with one of these smaller groups of buildings that is off the path. There is no inertia in the game, so as soon as you jump off the plane, you can travel the opposite way of the plane just as far as if you were going with it. But I don't recommend doing that because other players that got off the plane earlier will get to the same destination faster than you, which means they will probably have guns by the time you land. As I mentioned earlier, the items are randomized, but if you find a location that has a lot of great stuff, it will probably have a lot of great stuff every time you go there. So if you are pretty new to the game, I recommend going to the same place as much as you can to get really familiar with it, which will give you a huge advantage over other players that aren't as familiar with that area. After the plane leaves the island, a safe zone will appear. It will be a circle covering about a third of the island, and a timer will start with 5 minutes. When this timer runs out, a radiation zone will start closing in on that circle. The radiation zone wall moves slower or faster, based on how far it is to the closest edge of the new circle. This means that if you are far away from the circle, the radiation zone travels significantly faster than you can run.\n"

            "NEW DATA =  The process of the radiation zone shrinking the first time also takes exactly 5 minutes. At this point, a new safe zone appears, and the process repeats itself for a total of 9 phases. Here are the main stats on each of these phases. For those of you who have been playing for a while, these numbers may not seem that important, but now that you know them, you will be surprised how often this knowledge will affect your decisions. Knowing details about what is going on around you in a game can often increase confidence and reduce indecisiveness. In the beginning, you don't have to worry that much about the radiation zone because it only does 0.4 damage per second. But this damage increases each round, so by the time you get to the end of the game, the radiation zone does 11 damage per second, which makes it incredibly important to be in the safe zone. For those of you who are used to playing rules of survival where you can spend the first half of the game in the radiation zone, you will find this much more difficult to do in PUBG. As soon as you land, find a gun with ammo as quickly as possible. People can tell when you don't have a gun and they will chase you mercilessly until you are dead. Once you have a gun, I recommend searching for a rifle and ammo. SMGs are a much better option than they were in rules of survival, but having a rifle is one of your weapons is still really important. Even what your average bullet per kill ratio is, and then unless you have a really nice backpack stop gathering ammo after you have enough to kill 8 people. I promise that by the time you've killed those 8 people you will have found more ammo. If you see the shooting icon, don't assume they're shooting at you, but look around to see if you can find them. If you see them and they don't see you, don't attack them unless it's an easy kill. Long battles attract a lot of attention and should be avoided. Stay near buildings so that if you start taking damage and you don't see them, you can just run around a corner to buy you some time and set up if they chase you. Now if you're still in bronze, most of the players you will be fighting are AI players, which are really easy to kill. Do not let this easy competition make you develop bad habits. Try to always fight from a position where you have cover and if you don't have cover, try to get in the habit of moving while you shoot so that you do not become an easy target. Even if the player you're shooting does not see you start moving within 2 seconds after first firing your gun because if you shoot at someone while you are not in cover, it will likely attract the attention of someone else nearby and standing in the middle of the field will get you killed really quickly. So get in the habit of moving while you shoot every time you engage when you don't have cover to hide behind. If you're playing a team game, the most important thing you can do in the very early stage is stay close enough to your teammates so that you can support each other while you're looking for items. If you're playing competitively then you should have a good team and if you have a good team, then you should live or die as a team. Playing 3 vs 4 in a competitive game is stupid, especially because it's so easy to avoid. You also want to be on the lookout for good armor, helmets and backpacks. Level 3 items are the best in the game but they are also rare. Level 2 items are attainable but don't spend too much time trying to get all level 2 pieces. You can see what level your gear is from how many bars are here. Once you have some decent gear, you have several options on what to do next. PUBG is a multifaceted game. You get points for killing people, doing damage, getting supplies, surviving the longest and even get points for taking damage and then healing yourself. This gives you lots of options on how to play this game. If you want to know the 4 main strategies for how people play PUBG, I recommend checking out my video that lays out the pros and cons of all 4 of them. The only tactic that I don't mention in that video is the car rampage tactic. Using a car is your weapon is very effective. So much so that there are some players that are able to win solo games without ever shooting a gun. That tactic is a great option as is all the tactics I mentioned in that video and if you're going for points you should do whichever one best fits your strengths as a player. But in this video I'm going to be focusing on how to get first place. PUBG is not just a shooter game. You can be fun to play it that way and you still get lots of points doing it but if you want to get first place often you have to get out of that mentality. PUBG is also a survival game. Shooting a gun attracts attention and attention is a great way to die. If I see someone and they don't see me but I'm not in a good enough position to kill them and take on someone else that hears me kill them I just let them go. In fact if I'm really playing competitive like I'm trying to get first place every time I often just watch people for most of the game and only kill when I really have a good read on where everyone is at. The best place to hide is in tall grass on high ground near a rock or tree. For those of you who saw my rules of survival video my tactic where I hide in one of these little sheds with a shotgun is not nearly as effective in PUBG because it's not as easy to one shot someone so I seldom use this tactic when I'm playing PUBG. I still love using shotguns and I see a lot of pros use them in urban combat but I don't use the shed tactic. Now when you're part of a team there's no reason to hide because a well-positioned team that works well together can kill dozens of players without ever receiving a single casualty. The team simply has to make sure that they position themselves in a place that they can fight in any direction with little to moderate repositioning. They also need to make sure that they are close enough to each other that they can revive downed enemies without being exposed. The team that works well together under those conditions is almost invincible. A solo person however is not especially in PUBG. A lot of players are really good with a car 98 so drawing too much attention can be the end even if you're a really good player. If you are pushing hard for the first place position I recommend using one of these two tactics. If you find that you are already in the new safe zone when it appears I recommend staying in your hiding place for as long as you can. Look around to see where people are but don't kill anyone unless you are confident that you can kill them within 2 seconds of first firing your gun. Look at them if they are close but be super wary of other enemies since you just fired your gun. Even firing a gun with a suppressor will still alert enemies if they are close enough. In a team game if you shoot someone and they die without getting knocked down first then that means that all of their teammates are already dead. But if they get knocked down first instead of dying that means that at least one of their teammates is still alive and the guy you just knocked down can communicate your position to his teammates even after you kill him. So you want to kill him as soon as possible so his teammates don't revive him but you also want to be cautious when it happens and stick close to your teammates. It is incredibly hard for someone to see you when you are crawling in the grass if you are on high ground. But if you are on lower ground than them high grass is almost worthless. If you are on high ground and stay still people should not be able to see you unless you are within 7 meters or closer. If you find yourself outside of the new safe zone when it appears I recommend waiting as long as possible. You can run from cover to cover if you are careful to look around while you do it but I recommend giving other players a chance to get to the safe zone first. This might seem like horrible advice because a lot of players talk about killing people as they run to the safe zone but once you try it a couple times you will notice that that happens rarely. In PUBG most players die when an enemy notices them first. That enemy then fires at them when they are in bad position and they have very little chance of winning the fight. By letting other players go first you will find that you often see other players before they see you. In fact most of them will never see you because their back is turned to you most of the time as they run to safety. Usually by the end everyone is calling around at a field and behind cover and it is very hard to see them. If you are part of a team and there are no buildings in the safe zone I recommend spreading out about 4 to 8 meters from each other. This makes you close enough to support each other but far enough away that enemies will probably only see one of you at a time. If you are playing solo stay hidden as long as possible. Remember this tutorial is about getting first place so ideally you only have to kill one person to win but the closer you get to the end the harder it is to not run into someone. When you see someone get close kill them while you still have the advantage of shooting first then slowly crawl away from your kill while looking around because the loot box is noticeable from a distance and your enemies will likely be looking for you to loot your kill.\n"

            "NEW DATA =  When you are down to the last two the safe zone is usually pretty small right now. I am not very good at throwing grenades so I have usually saved up about 5 or more grenades at this point. If you see the other guy but they are in cover chunk all of your grenades at them. Remember to wait a second or two before throwing it so they don't have as much time to run away but obviously don't wait 3 seconds or you will be giving them an easy win. Even the more likely scenario you do not see them but the safe zone is very small I recommend throwing one of your grenades at every tree and rock that is in the safe zone. This is kind of a controversial tactic because if they are close enough they can hear you pull the pin on your grenade and if they are watching they will either see you or the grenade in the air which will let them get an idea for where you are at. And I agree with those objections in theory but in practice I find that this tactic almost always works out to your favorite because the grenades usually get people to come out of their cover or reveal where they are and I only do this when I have a really good position. So in my experience it either works or they weren't in cover because they were crawling on the grass and it doesn't seem to have an effect either way. So I recommend trying it out for yourself and see if you can land the first place spot. In addition to those 99 tips and tricks I have 52 more for you. There seems to be a lot of confusion even among advanced players on how boost items work. I hear a lot of people say that energy drinks give you movement speed but painkillers do not. That is not true. Energy items do not give you any benefits in and of themselves. Rather they give you points towards your boost meter and your boost meter gives you benefits. It's important to think this way because if you don't you will get confused. There are very advanced websites out there that say things like energy drinks will restore 23% of your health. That is not true. If you use an energy drink well it can heal up to 52% of your health. Here's how the boost system works. When you use a boost item it gives you a percentage of your boost meter which diminishes over time. This meter consists of a total of 5 minutes. Energy drinks give you 40% of that meter which is equal to 2 minutes. Energy drinks will give you 60% which is equal to 3 minutes and the adrenaline syringe gives you 100% which covers the whole 5 minutes. You get different benefits based on how much boost you have in your boost meter. So using an energy drink by itself actually only heals 22% of your health. But that is not the best way to use an energy drink. If you use a painkiller and then an energy drink that same energy drink will heal 52% of your health and give you a move in speed bonus of either 2.5 or 6.2% based on which bar you are on. And then after 2 minutes when your bar drops back down to 60%. You can use another energy drink to get another 52% of your health back and have another move in speed bonus. So that's how the boost system works in PUBG. If you want to know more about my strategy on how to maximize this system to your advantage be sure to check out my video titled How to get double healing from energy drinks. To just recently added the flare gun into the game you need to aim towards the sky in order to use it. Using it outside the safe zone will spawn an armored vehicle and using it inside the safe zone will spawn a special air drop with twice the normal loot. The developers never actually added infrastructure to these towers so you cannot land on them no matter how hard you try. But there is a way to use the lean function to get a little bit up this tower. While clearing a house or going around a corner you can use your third person camera to peek around the other side which is an effective way to stay safe while scouting. While driving a vehicle you can see its health and fuel bar shown here. You can also tell when one of your tires has been destroyed because the corresponding icon will turn red. Peek as much as you can even when you're in a house but remember that staying inside a house can sometimes become a death trap if you are up against a player who is skilled with grenades. While shooting through a window or any small hole you will notice that you do not always shoot where your crosshairs are. Remember to leave more space below your aim so that you don't hit the wall in front of you while you are shooting. Short grass will actually disappear once you are more than 150 meters away from the grass so don't try to hide in short grass. Zooming in doesn't just magnify it allows you to see as if you were actually closer. So some players will appear that weren't previously visible. Unlike most other shooter games PUBG has implemented a bullet drop for every gun so remember to aim high when trying to shoot longer range shots. Especially on guns that do not have a high range stat. This is again where the armory is particularly helpful. If you unequip all your weapons you can run much faster. If you do this your character will move 6.3 meters per second so that's a good way to measure how long it will take you to reach the safe zone. If you're too far from the circle try to look for a vehicle. You can usually find them along roads. You can use downed enemies as bait to get their teammates to come try to revive them but make sure you kill them before they reach cover. I personally like to put all of my guns on single fire mode. I find that the extra headshots more than make up for the slow rate of fire. If the safe zone covers the outer sea you can swim away from the shore and survive a really long time but doing this will probably make it more difficult to get first place because you have to get back to shore before you can fire your gun. You can't heal beyond 75% health level except when you are using med kits, energy drinks, pills or the adrenaline syringe. While the crossbow and pubg looks awesome and it can one shot an unarmored enemy even with a body shot which can sometimes make it useful in the initial scramble it is actually a terrible weapon. It has a long reloading time and you get one shot at a time. The only thing that's good about this weapon is that it makes absolutely no noise. Always choose a pan over other melee weapons it has higher damage and it can block bullets. I know this is a tip for doing better at the game but I strongly recommend checking out the Viva Lidert League YouTube channel. I'm pretty busy with work and family and I don't have time to watch a lot of YouTube channels but I watch and like every single pubgie video these guys make and several of their other series. Just watch this one video from them and then when you fall in love with them remember that JCF was the one that sent you. Smoke grenades are useful for reviving a teammate or repositioning but remember to throw them quite a bit in front of the area that you were trying to cover because they don't cover the area immediately near where they land. Please pay attention to your mini map even when you're using a scope to see where your enemy is shooting from. Audio is really important this game since a lot of noises like opening doors, looting, healing, pulling the pen on a grenade, a thrown grenade and most footsteps do not give these notifications. If you are wanting to play competitively I recommend using a good headset so that you not only hear those noises but a good headset will help you identify where those noises are coming from. Here you have full health before getting into a fight and using painkillers and boost right before engaging an enemy is a great way to give yourself an advantage in a fight especially at the end of the game when options are the most limited. Wearing darker clothes like black shirt, black pants etc is best for the main map, airing out but they make you easier to spot in Miramar. Natural colors like yellow and gray are the best if you want to play on that map. Like I said earlier I almost always put my weapons on single shot but this is especially important if you are trying to shoot someone from far away because the recoil of the gun is magnified the further distance you shoot. When you are parachuting down use the eye icon to see how many players and teams are dropping at the same place as you. After you kill someone don't just stand there and loot their body that's a great way to get snipe. Just grab what you can within one second and then get out. When you get shot at never ever ever start crawling or crouching. This is a very common new mistake. Having and crawling is helpful for hiding behind cover and not getting notice in the first place. They actually make you an easier target because they make you go slower. Always use the left fire button when using a scope because you will need your right thumb to aim. When you want to show your teammate where an enemy is at just move your crosshair over the enemy and then click the enemy ahead dialogue in the chat. Having scopes with higher magnification is always more useful than a lower one but do not equip a six time scope or higher on both of your items or it will severely weaken your close quarter combat. Moving silently in PUBG is a lot more difficult than rules of survival. So if you are playing a solo game I don't recommend staying too long in buildings. Using the boost option for vehicles requires a lot more gas and creates more noise so I don't recommend using it unless you are getting shot at or trying to outrun the radiation zone.\n",
            "REM DATA =  When there are only two people in a car sit on the same side so the driver can position the car as a shield in combat. While you are swimming pay attention to your lung function. If it is turning red that means the game is thinking that you are still submerged in water even though your character looks like it's not. Pressing crouch will let you submerge into water and jump will allow you to surface. If you are trying to get to the safe zone or escape an enemy fire by swimming submerging is a great way to increase your safety. Bullets can penetrate water but the damage is significantly reduced. You are also obviously harder to spot when you are underwater. And then lastly if you are pretty new to the game I recommend avoiding motorcycles because they can be pretty difficult to master and it is much easier for other enemies to kill you. Well that's it guys hope that helps. Obviously compiling that was a lot of work so please remember to like this video if you did in fact like this video and if you liked it a lot can you please share it on your Facebook and Discord groups so that more people can see it. JCF is a pretty new channel and it really helps me grow. Alright guys I'll see you next time.\n",

            "[{'prompt': '', 'completion': \" J.CF is short for Hugando Conforza, which is Spanish for playing with force, but is also play on words because my character's name is Forza. So I'm playing with Forza. After helping develop the Battle Royale concept for games like Armour and H1Z1, Brendan Green, known by his alias player unknown, was hired as a creative developer at Bluehole to realize his vision for the genre in his game Player Unknown's Battleground, which exploded into and is still currently considered the defining game of the genre, even though later Fortnite used 3-to-play concepts to surpass it in size and income. Today I'm going to give you 151 tips and tricks for PUBG. When you first sign up, you will be given the chance to choose a name and customize a character. A lot of players will tell you that the female character has a smaller hitbox and therefore gives you a tactical advantage, but the developers of the game have clarified that even though the girl character is smaller than the guy, the hitboxes are identical. Upon hearing this, some players will still push back saying that there might be a tactical advantage in choosing a girl because she is smaller and therefore harder to see, but since 99% of finding someone has to do with noise and camouflage levels, which are also identical between genders, these claims are at-fess and significant. After choosing your character, you will be brought to the menu screen. Before getting started, I recommend clicking on the settings button here to customize a few things. On the basic tab, enabling Amuses lets the game move the crosshairs for you a little bit, which I personally like, but it is not always helpful because enemies don't always move in the direction the game anticipates, which in those instances it can actually throw you off. Using the release option on these different firing modes gives you more precision when firing, but it also takes a while to get used to it, so I wouldn't recommend doing that unless you're an advanced player. I strongly recommend enabling peak and fire even if you're a new player because this is something you want to get good at eventually, but I wouldn't recommend selecting the whole to lean unless you're an advanced player. I keep all the other settings in this tab on their default, but it is important to note that auto-open doors can cause you to accidentally open a door at the wrong time, alerting nearby enemies to your location. In the graphics tab, setting the style the colorful will increase contrast and make it easier to see other players, and selecting a high frame rate will give your reaction time a slight advantage. This makes graphics the least important setting in this tab so it just it based on what your phone can handle. Since I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S7, which is becoming an older phone, I keep my graphics on the lowest possible setting and I keep all the other settings on default. In the controls tab, I recommend clicking the Customize button and adjusting your peak and fire buttons to be a little bit closer so you don't have to extend your thumb so far. I also recommend reducing the distance of the sprint button just a little bit and moving all of these buttons here on the right just a little bit closer to each other. Those are my favorite settings, but ultimately you need to find what works best for you. If you want to experiment with something, I recommend first trying it out in a new layout so that you can revert back to your old customized settings if you don't like it. You'll notice in my third layout that I have my shooting buttons at the top of my screen, because I bought these cool little trigger things for three bucks online from some company in China. I'm still getting the hang of them, but once I figure them out, I think having those two extra fingers will be a game changer. So if you want to try them, I'll put links to where to buy them in the description. I recommend disabling auto pickup because once you know what you're doing, it usually slows you down or crowds up your inventory. I keep all the settings on the other tabs at their default, but after you've been playing for a while, you might want to browse through them to see if you want to adjust anything. Now that we've talked about settings, let me touch briefly on the menu screen. You can customize all your game settings here, including perspective, server, modes, maps, teams, etc. Whatever you set here will be remembered and you will use those settings every time you click start. You can add friends by clicking on this button and then selecting the Add Friend tab and then typing your friend's name or character ID in this search bar. You can then invite those friends into your party using this button, but if you don't have any friends, the game will automatically select teammates for you. Joining a clan is a great way to find friends and forming a crew makes it easy to find your closest friends quickly. After you've played a few games, I recommend spending some time in the armory. The armory lets you see the stats on every single gun in the game and how that gun interacts with the various mods you can find for it. This is incredibly helpful for knowing which gun you want to keep on the battlefield. If you're free to play gamer, there are only two parts of the shop that apply to you. First one is the soldier crate. You can be bought for battle points which you get from logging in and playing the game. Missions for getting these points are either reset daily or weekly on Sunday at 6pm central standard time, which is also when the soldier crate price resets. The second one is the redeemed section. These items can be bought with the tokens you get for dismantling clothing duplicates. If you are not a free to play player, the best way to support the devs is to buy one of these elite season passes because they offer more rewards per dollar than any other offer. All of these other tabs are either not important at all or you will see a red dot when they do become important. So when you have everything set up the way you want it, click start. If you're playing on a team, the most important thing you can do is communicate with your teammates. In addition to an in game chat system, PUBG has implemented several ways to help a team communicate and work together. The first way is accessible by clicking on the mini map, this will pull up a bigger map. By clicking anywhere on this map, it will automatically set a marker that you and your teammates can see. This is helpful for a lot of reasons, but the most common thing this is used for is telling your teammates where you want to go. You can also click on this tab here which allows you to follow a teammate or invite them to follow you. This makes it really easy for your team to end up in the same place and reduces your chance of miscommunication. Lastly, if you do not want to use the voice chat, you can click the dialog button here, which gives you a ton of communication options. Some of these options have further meaning based on what you are pointing at when you use them. These in vehicles on the map are randomized each time you play, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't pay attention to where you got something, because certain places are more likely to give better weapons than others. If you get really familiar with an area, you will have a huge upper hand on someone that is just wandering around aimlessly. As a general rule, these areas have more and better loot, but most players know that, so they tend to be more heavily sought after. If you are playing a solo game, I strongly recommend avoiding these places if they are close to where the plane enters the map. All of the players are in the exact same plane as you, and most players have a tendency to exit the plane earlier. You can see which players have exited the plane by this number right here. If you are a confident player, I recommend finding one of these good locations that is off the path and marking it on your map. The maximum distance you can travel after jumping out of the plane is around 1500 meters. Some players will tell you that you can extend this distance by opening up your parachute early or slowing down your movement speed, but this is not true for PUBG Mobile, and using this approach just delays how fast you get weapons. If you are a less confident player, I recommend doing the same thing with one of these smaller groups of buildings that is off the path. There is no inertia in the game, so as soon as you jump off the plane, you can travel the opposite way of the plane just as far as if you were going with it. But I don't recommend doing that because other players that got off the plane earlier will get to the same destination faster than you, which means they will probably have guns by the time you land. As I mentioned earlier, the items are randomized, but if you find a location that has a lot of great stuff, it will probably have a lot of great stuff every time you go there. So if you are pretty new to the game, I recommend going to the same place as much as you can to get really familiar with it, which will give you a huge advantage over other players that aren't as familiar with that area. After the plane leaves the island, a safe zone will appear. It will be a circle covering about a third of the island, and a timer will start with 5 minutes. When this timer runs out, a radiation zone will start closing in on that circle. The radiation zone wall moves slower or faster, based on how far it is to the closest edge of the new circle. This means that if you are far away from the circle, the radiation zone travels significantly faster than you can run.\"}, {'prompt': '', 'completion': \" The process of the radiation zone shrinking the first time also takes exactly 5 minutes. At this point, a new safe zone appears, and the process repeats itself for a total of 9 phases. Here are the main stats on each of these phases. For those of you who have been playing for a while, these numbers may not seem that important, but now that you know them, you will be surprised how often this knowledge will affect your decisions. Knowing details about what is going on around you in a game can often increase confidence and reduce indecisiveness. In the beginning, you don't have to worry that much about the radiation zone because it only does 0.4 damage per second. But this damage increases each round, so by the time you get to the end of the game, the radiation zone does 11 damage per second, which makes it incredibly important to be in the safe zone. For those of you who are used to playing rules of survival where you can spend the first half of the game in the radiation zone, you will find this much more difficult to do in PUBG. As soon as you land, find a gun with ammo as quickly as possible. People can tell when you don't have a gun and they will chase you mercilessly until you are dead. Once you have a gun, I recommend searching for a rifle and ammo. SMGs are a much better option than they were in rules of survival, but having a rifle is one of your weapons is still really important. Even what your average bullet per kill ratio is, and then unless you have a really nice backpack stop gathering ammo after you have enough to kill 8 people. I promise that by the time you've killed those 8 people you will have found more ammo. If you see the shooting icon, don't assume they're shooting at you, but look around to see if you can find them. If you see them and they don't see you, don't attack them unless it's an easy kill. Long battles attract a lot of attention and should be avoided. Stay near buildings so that if you start taking damage and you don't see them, you can just run around a corner to buy you some time and set up if they chase you. Now if you're still in bronze, most of the players you will be fighting are AI players, which are really easy to kill. Do not let this easy competition make you develop bad habits. Try to always fight from a position where you have cover and if you don't have cover, try to get in the habit of moving while you shoot so that you do not become an easy target. Even if the player you're shooting does not see you start moving within 2 seconds after first firing your gun because if you shoot at someone while you are not in cover, it will likely attract the attention of someone else nearby and standing in the middle of the field will get you killed really quickly. So get in the habit of moving while you shoot every time you engage when you don't have cover to hide behind. If you're playing a team game, the most important thing you can do in the very early stage is stay close enough to your teammates so that you can support each other while you're looking for items. If you're playing competitively then you should have a good team and if you have a good team, then you should live or die as a team. Playing 3 vs 4 in a competitive game is stupid, especially because it's so easy to avoid. You also want to be on the lookout for good armor, helmets and backpacks. Level 3 items are the best in the game but they are also rare. Level 2 items are attainable but don't spend too much time trying to get all level 2 pieces. You can see what level your gear is from how many bars are here. Once you have some decent gear, you have several options on what to do next. PUBG is a multifaceted game. You get points for killing people, doing damage, getting supplies, surviving the longest and even get points for taking damage and then healing yourself. This gives you lots of options on how to play this game. If you want to know the 4 main strategies for how people play PUBG, I recommend checking out my video that lays out the pros and cons of all 4 of them. The only tactic that I don't mention in that video is the car rampage tactic. Using a car is your weapon is very effective. So much so that there are some players that are able to win solo games without ever shooting a gun. That tactic is a great option as is all the tactics I mentioned in that video and if you're going for points you should do whichever one best fits your strengths as a player. But in this video I'm going to be focusing on how to get first place. PUBG is not just a shooter game. You can be fun to play it that way and you still get lots of points doing it but if you want to get first place often you have to get out of that mentality. PUBG is also a survival game. Shooting a gun attracts attention and attention is a great way to die. If I see someone and they don't see me but I'm not in a good enough position to kill them and take on someone else that hears me kill them I just let them go. In fact if I'm really playing competitive like I'm trying to get first place every time I often just watch people for most of the game and only kill when I really have a good read on where everyone is at. The best place to hide is in tall grass on high ground near a rock or tree. For those of you who saw my rules of survival video my tactic where I hide in one of these little sheds with a shotgun is not nearly as effective in PUBG because it's not as easy to one shot someone so I seldom use this tactic when I'm playing PUBG. I still love using shotguns and I see a lot of pros use them in urban combat but I don't use the shed tactic. Now when you're part of a team there's no reason to hide because a well-positioned team that works well together can kill dozens of players without ever receiving a single casualty. The team simply has to make sure that they position themselves in a place that they can fight in any direction with little to moderate repositioning. They also need to make sure that they are close enough to each other that they can revive downed enemies without being exposed. The team that works well together under those conditions is almost invincible. A solo person however is not especially in PUBG. A lot of players are really good with a car 98 so drawing too much attention can be the end even if you're a really good player. If you are pushing hard for the first place position I recommend using one of these two tactics. If you find that you are already in the new safe zone when it appears I recommend staying in your hiding place for as long as you can. Look around to see where people are but don't kill anyone unless you are confident that you can kill them within 2 seconds of first firing your gun. Look at them if they are close but be super wary of other enemies since you just fired your gun. Even firing a gun with a suppressor will still alert enemies if they are close enough. In a team game if you shoot someone and they die without getting knocked down first then that means that all of their teammates are already dead. But if they get knocked down first instead of dying that means that at least one of their teammates is still alive and the guy you just knocked down can communicate your position to his teammates even after you kill him. So you want to kill him as soon as possible so his teammates don't revive him but you also want to be cautious when it happens and stick close to your teammates. It is incredibly hard for someone to see you when you are crawling in the grass if you are on high ground. But if you are on lower ground than them high grass is almost worthless. If you are on high ground and stay still people should not be able to see you unless you are within 7 meters or closer. If you find yourself outside of the new safe zone when it appears I recommend waiting as long as possible. You can run from cover to cover if you are careful to look around while you do it but I recommend giving other players a chance to get to the safe zone first. This might seem like horrible advice because a lot of players talk about killing people as they run to the safe zone but once you try it a couple times you will notice that that happens rarely. In PUBG most players die when an enemy notices them first. That enemy then fires at them when they are in bad position and they have very little chance of winning the fight. By letting other players go first you will find that you often see other players before they see you. In fact most of them will never see you because their back is turned to you most of the time as they run to safety. Usually by the end everyone is calling around at a field and behind cover and it is very hard to see them. If you are part of a team and there are no buildings in the safe zone I recommend spreading out about 4 to 8 meters from each other. This makes you close enough to support each other but far enough away that enemies will probably only see one of you at a time. If you are playing solo stay hidden as long as possible. Remember this tutorial is about getting first place so ideally you only have to kill one person to win but the closer you get to the end the harder it is to not run into someone. When you see someone get close kill them while you still have the advantage of shooting first then slowly crawl away from your kill while looking around because the loot box is noticeable from a distance and your enemies will likely be looking for you to loot your kill.\"}, {'prompt': '', 'completion': \" When you are down to the last two the safe zone is usually pretty small right now. I am not very good at throwing grenades so I have usually saved up about 5 or more grenades at this point. If you see the other guy but they are in cover chunk all of your grenades at them. Remember to wait a second or two before throwing it so they don't have as much time to run away but obviously don't wait 3 seconds or you will be giving them an easy win. Even the more likely scenario you do not see them but the safe zone is very small I recommend throwing one of your grenades at every tree and rock that is in the safe zone. This is kind of a controversial tactic because if they are close enough they can hear you pull the pin on your grenade and if they are watching they will either see you or the grenade in the air which will let them get an idea for where you are at. And I agree with those objections in theory but in practice I find that this tactic almost always works out to your favorite because the grenades usually get people to come out of their cover or reveal where they are and I only do this when I have a really good position. So in my experience it either works or they weren't in cover because they were crawling on the grass and it doesn't seem to have an effect either way. So I recommend trying it out for yourself and see if you can land the first place spot. In addition to those 99 tips and tricks I have 52 more for you. There seems to be a lot of confusion even among advanced players on how boost items work. I hear a lot of people say that energy drinks give you movement speed but painkillers do not. That is not true. Energy items do not give you any benefits in and of themselves. Rather they give you points towards your boost meter and your boost meter gives you benefits. It's important to think this way because if you don't you will get confused. There are very advanced websites out there that say things like energy drinks will restore 23% of your health. That is not true. If you use an energy drink well it can heal up to 52% of your health. Here's how the boost system works. When you use a boost item it gives you a percentage of your boost meter which diminishes over time. This meter consists of a total of 5 minutes. Energy drinks give you 40% of that meter which is equal to 2 minutes. Energy drinks will give you 60% which is equal to 3 minutes and the adrenaline syringe gives you 100% which covers the whole 5 minutes. You get different benefits based on how much boost you have in your boost meter. So using an energy drink by itself actually only heals 22% of your health. But that is not the best way to use an energy drink. If you use a painkiller and then an energy drink that same energy drink will heal 52% of your health and give you a move in speed bonus of either 2.5 or 6.2% based on which bar you are on. And then after 2 minutes when your bar drops back down to 60%. You can use another energy drink to get another 52% of your health back and have another move in speed bonus. So that's how the boost system works in PUBG. If you want to know more about my strategy on how to maximize this system to your advantage be sure to check out my video titled How to get double healing from energy drinks. To just recently added the flare gun into the game you need to aim towards the sky in order to use it. Using it outside the safe zone will spawn an armored vehicle and using it inside the safe zone will spawn a special air drop with twice the normal loot. The developers never actually added infrastructure to these towers so you cannot land on them no matter how hard you try. But there is a way to use the lean function to get a little bit up this tower. While clearing a house or going around a corner you can use your third person camera to peek around the other side which is an effective way to stay safe while scouting. While driving a vehicle you can see its health and fuel bar shown here. You can also tell when one of your tires has been destroyed because the corresponding icon will turn red. Peek as much as you can even when you're in a house but remember that staying inside a house can sometimes become a death trap if you are up against a player who is skilled with grenades. While shooting through a window or any small hole you will notice that you do not always shoot where your crosshairs are. Remember to leave more space below your aim so that you don't hit the wall in front of you while you are shooting. Short grass will actually disappear once you are more than 150 meters away from the grass so don't try to hide in short grass. Zooming in doesn't just magnify it allows you to see as if you were actually closer. So some players will appear that weren't previously visible. Unlike most other shooter games PUBG has implemented a bullet drop for every gun so remember to aim high when trying to shoot longer range shots. Especially on guns that do not have a high range stat. This is again where the armory is particularly helpful. If you unequip all your weapons you can run much faster. If you do this your character will move 6.3 meters per second so that's a good way to measure how long it will take you to reach the safe zone. If you're too far from the circle try to look for a vehicle. You can usually find them along roads. You can use downed enemies as bait to get their teammates to come try to revive them but make sure you kill them before they reach cover. I personally like to put all of my guns on single fire mode. I find that the extra headshots more than make up for the slow rate of fire. If the safe zone covers the outer sea you can swim away from the shore and survive a really long time but doing this will probably make it more difficult to get first place because you have to get back to shore before you can fire your gun. You can't heal beyond 75% health level except when you are using med kits, energy drinks, pills or the adrenaline syringe. While the crossbow and pubg looks awesome and it can one shot an unarmored enemy even with a body shot which can sometimes make it useful in the initial scramble it is actually a terrible weapon. It has a long reloading time and you get one shot at a time. The only thing that's good about this weapon is that it makes absolutely no noise. Always choose a pan over other melee weapons it has higher damage and it can block bullets. I know this is a tip for doing better at the game but I strongly recommend checking out the Viva Lidert League YouTube channel. I'm pretty busy with work and family and I don't have time to watch a lot of YouTube channels but I watch and like every single pubgie video these guys make and several of their other series. Just watch this one video from them and then when you fall in love with them remember that JCF was the one that sent you. Smoke grenades are useful for reviving a teammate or repositioning but remember to throw them quite a bit in front of the area that you were trying to cover because they don't cover the area immediately near where they land. Please pay attention to your mini map even when you're using a scope to see where your enemy is shooting from. Audio is really important this game since a lot of noises like opening doors, looting, healing, pulling the pen on a grenade, a thrown grenade and most footsteps do not give these notifications. If you are wanting to play competitively I recommend using a good headset so that you not only hear those noises but a good headset will help you identify where those noises are coming from. Here you have full health before getting into a fight and using painkillers and boost right before engaging an enemy is a great way to give yourself an advantage in a fight especially at the end of the game when options are the most limited. Wearing darker clothes like black shirt, black pants etc is best for the main map, airing out but they make you easier to spot in Miramar. Natural colors like yellow and gray are the best if you want to play on that map. Like I said earlier I almost always put my weapons on single shot but this is especially important if you are trying to shoot someone from far away because the recoil of the gun is magnified the further distance you shoot. When you are parachuting down use the eye icon to see how many players and teams are dropping at the same place as you. After you kill someone don't just stand there and loot their body that's a great way to get snipe. Just grab what you can within one second and then get out. When you get shot at never ever ever start crawling or crouching. This is a very common new mistake. Having and crawling is helpful for hiding behind cover and not getting notice in the first place. They actually make you an easier target because they make you go slower. Always use the left fire button when using a scope because you will need your right thumb to aim. When you want to show your teammate where an enemy is at just move your crosshair over the enemy and then click the enemy ahead dialogue in the chat. Having scopes with higher magnification is always more useful than a lower one but do not equip a six time scope or higher on both of your items or it will severely weaken your close quarter combat. Moving silently in PUBG is a lot more difficult than rules of survival. So if you are playing a solo game I don't recommend staying too long in buildings. Using the boost option for vehicles requires a lot more gas and creates more noise so I don't recommend using it unless you are getting shot at or trying to outrun the radiation zone.\"}, {'prompt': '', 'completion': \" When there are only two people in a car sit on the same side so the driver can position the car as a shield in combat. While you are swimming pay attention to your lung function. If it is turning red that means the game is thinking that you are still submerged in water even though your character looks like it's not. Pressing crouch will let you submerge into water and jump will allow you to surface. If you are trying to get to the safe zone or escape an enemy fire by swimming submerging is a great way to increase your safety. Bullets can penetrate water but the damage is significantly reduced. You are also obviously harder to spot when you are underwater. And then lastly if you are pretty new to the game I recommend avoiding motorcycles because they can be pretty difficult to master and it is much easier for other enemies to kill you. Well that's it guys hope that helps. Obviously compiling that was a lot of work so please remember to like this video if you did in fact like this video and if you liked it a lot can you please share it on your Facebook and Discord groups so that more people can see it. JCF is a pretty new channel and it really helps me grow. Alright guys I'll see you next time.\"}]\n"

            "[{'prompt': '', 'completion': \" Welcome guys, so in this video, I will give you 10 tips and tricks for the new Caracan map that you need to know as a pub G player And I hope it will help you to become a better player at this game Starting with the first tip, how to land faster, so usually in other maps you jump out of a plane at 800 meters But in Caracan, you need to make that jump at around 350 meters and then pull your joystick at a 45 degree angle Example like this, in this way, you will reach the maximum diving speed that is 234 kilometers per hour If everything goes right, you will land exactly at your marked location And in Caracan, you get an exclusive new weapon called Panzerfaust It's a one-time use rocket launcher or an explosive weapon extremely powerful and dangerous So in this video, I will tell you how to properly use the Panzerfaust But first you need to understand how powerful it is So the Panzerfaust will kill everyone under 4 meters of its explosive radius Sometimes it can kill even up to 5 meters of its radius So let me show you how much damage does Panzerfaust will deal So it's 0 to 2 meters the enemy will obviously die and at 4 meters the enemy will most likely to die If didn't die, then the enemy will lose 90% of their health and at 6 meters The enemy will lose 60 to 90% of health depending on the explosion and where you hit And at 8 meters, you deal 25% damage And remember this is just approximate values, the real one might deal more damage or less damage, depending on the explosion and situation So how to use the Panzerfaust, it's very simple, but sometimes it could be difficult But you just have to aim really close to the enemy and hit, mostly at the ground since it's more effective And do not aim for the enemy because if they move you will miss your shot, so always aim really close to the enemy and fire And in close range fights, don't be afraid of blowing yourself up because you only lose 25% HP with Panzerfaust explosion But your enemies will die immediately And also when you shoot Panzerfaust at your teammates, your teammates won't die, but they do lose 25% of HP just like you You can use Panzerfaust to shoot accurately up to 150 meters since it has 3 adjustment modes, 60, 100 and 150 meters All you have to do is aim at your enemy and mark the location, which will tell you how far as the target is, then click on the adjust button and adjust according to the distance and then fire The Panzerfaust is a really powerful weapon, it deals damage to targets within 6 meters of the impact point, so when shooting at really far targets you have to be really accurate since you get only one shot The Panzerfaust will spawn around Karakhan at really low rates and as for my experience, it seems to be more common in the hidden areas such as undergrounds and the few hidden buildings where you need to blast your way into to get inside Speaking of undergrounds, the only way you can enter these undergrounds is by a bunker and you need to have a C4 or sticky bomb with you to break into those bunkers Here is a tip about bunkers and always remember this thing, the bunkers with a flag on them will have an underground route so you can enter those But the bunkers with no flag will have no entrance to the underground, they are just bunkers which you can hide inside, but no underground, by the way, here is the location for the biggest underground tunnel, it located right here And another way to find it is to loot an air drop as it is at 100% guaranteed that you will find one Anyway moving on to the next Karakhan exclusive thing is sticky bombs which replaces grenades in this map so you won't find any grenades in Karakhan, you only find the Molotovs and Flash grenades Sticky bombs will deal damage to targets within 4 meters of the impact point Sticky bomb damages is shown here, it will kill everyone under 3 meters of its impact point and if you're at 3.5 meters you will lose around 70% of your HP and if you're at 4 meters, you will lose 25% of your HP and at 5 meters away, the sticky bomb will not deal any damage, its effective range is only up to 4 meters The red zone or the purple zone in Karakhan is a bit different than other one, it's called the Demolition Zone which will destroy some of the buildings randomly inside the red zone So if you find yourself in a red zone on Karakhan, I highly recommend you to get out of the buildings because this red zone will only destroy buildings and if you're inside one of them, you will directly get knocked finished immediately, your teammates won't be able to revive you Even if your building is not completely inside the red zone area, I highly recommend you to get out from that area before it's too late And here is a tactical tip for Karakhan, take those advantages of high grounds, such as buildings and mountains, use the high hills for your advantage, it's harder for the enemies to hit you, especially if you have rocks as your cover And also when doing a rotation or moving to the safe zone, travel from mountain to mountain, never leave the high ground advantage that you have, otherwise you will get stuck at low grounds I'd highly recommend you to go from hill to hill even if it takes longer, never go low hill And the last thing is, there are few walls in Karakhan which can easily be penetrated with gunshots, so be careful hiding behind those walls And also you can destroy the entire walls with a panzer-fost or a sticky bomb Anyway, that's all I got for this video I hope you learned something new, if you did hit the like button and

For example, you have your enemies holding on this exact apartment building while you're on this one, as shown in the video, this is like one of the most common situation in school apartments. Most people usually attack them by going through the stairs which is extremely dangerous because you have no idea where the enemies are camping, that's why using this method will most likely help you to kill them easily. You have to do the following process in order to make that surprise attack, first you need to jump on this rooftop of your enemies apartment in this way. And now go towards the corner of the rooftop as shown here, now you need to jump in order to climb up the small wall of the rooftop's edge example like this. And now look towards the window and then go forward or move your joystick towards the window example like this, there are few things you need to make sure before you do this, you need to stand on this edge of the wall exactly as shown here, otherwise you might fail to enter inside the window. And the next thing, when you move towards the window, you will either slide into the room like this or you will get stuck at outside of the window like this, you just need to hit the climb up to get inside, so I would recommend tapping the climb button when you're close to the window so you'll automatically climb into the room. By the way, this trick works on other sides as well. And similarly you can also do the same thing in open rooftop apartments, while your enemies are rushing from stairs, you can easily surprise attack them. And also if you know there is someone below you, you could throw grenades, it will work extremely good if you properly cook them until timer is at 2-3 seconds. Moving on to the next tip, it's for TDM players, so you most probably aware of this camping spot, or at least got killed more than once from here, so I will show you a grenade lineup that will most likely kill the campers at this spot. To throw the grenade you need to come right at this exact location, and from here, you need to aim for this exact spot with your crosshair, and now jump throw the grenade, if you do it perfectly it will land near the enemy and blows up. Few things you gotta make sure while throwing a grenade is to cook the grenade until the timer reaches 4 seconds, and then when you're jump throwing it, first, release your grenade, or release your finger from the fire button, and then hit the jump button, your grenade will land perfectly near the enemy, and you will get the kill. If you jump and release the grenade at the same time, it may not work, because you have to release the grenade first and then jump. By the way, there is a new arena map, and I have a grenade lineup on this map, usually people camp in this spawn location in this map, so in order to throw the grenade over there, you need to do as followed. So you need to come near this container, and align yourself example like me. Make sure that you're leaning towards right side, and now aim with your crosshair at this spot, and most importantly cook the grenade until timer reaches 3 seconds, and then simply throw it. And the grenade will blow up exactly as it reaches spawn location. This grenade will most likely kill, or damage anyone who are camping at this spawn location. Now to the next tip, this is kind of opposite of first trick, so you're in this school apartment, while your enemies are on this open rooftop apartment. And if you try to throw grenade from here, it's really hard, because if you throw it will either fall off from the apartment or you will get yourself knock while throwing it, so let me show you a safe and best way to throw grenades in this situation. First thing, get on the highest floor, and then go into the specific room, and then climb up the window frame in this way, and yes don't forget to switch to FPP first person. So from here your enemies can't see you and you can't see them, but how can we throw a grenade from here? That's why we rely on certain spots to aim, so you need to place your crosshair at this spot, while throwing the grenade example like this. And cook the grenade until timer reaches really close to two seconds mark, and then throw it, it will blow up right on your enemies rooftop. Cooking the grenade is really important, if you don't cook it properly, then it will most probably go near the stairs area, if you cook it perfectly then it would blow up right in the air at this location. Anyway, that's all I got for this video, I hope you learned something new, if you did hit the like button, and subscribe for more upcoming videos like these, enjoy my bot gameplay, see you guys in the next one. I never say, I'm a fool, to that light, but every time I try to breathe away, kill me, will I love, and I have faith. So I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die, I'll stop that I don't die, just have you die. So I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die, just have you die. I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die, just have you die. When I choose doubt you, I'll just get out of here. I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die, I'll stop that I don't die. So I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die, just have you die. Not to leave peace. I hope I can go back, and you should know that I don't die. Watch out.\"}, {'prompt': '', 'completion': \" Welcome guys, so in the new update, we have a new mode called Traverse Insected. You can become an insect in this mode, and also there is a new glitch to get unlimited amount of flare drops. You can get as many as flare drops with this glitch, which I will show you later in this video on how you can get unlimited flare drops. But first let me give you introduction on this new Traverse mode. The first thing you would notice is that there are five new icons in the map, those are labs, or research center, you will get a decent amount of loot here. But currently they are hot drops, so most people will land here, and finding a gun is big challenge, if you're lucky you might get one. And when you're in the lab, there is this machine which is going to make you smaller, you need to get inside of this machine, and then click on the Transform button, now you will transform into a small insect example like this. But sometimes when you click on the transform, it just disappears, if it does disappear for you, then turn off your gyroscope, and now try again, but when you're transforming you need to make sure that you don't move, if you move even slightly it's going to cancel the transformation, so you have to stand still until the transformation is completed. And there is a glitch to get unlimited number of flare ammo, for this you need a flare gun, you don't need the ammo, if you do have it, then drop it on the floor, and now go into the machine, and transform yourself into an insect. And go out from the machine for a second, and get back into the machine, and transform into your normal form, now you will get the flare gun with ammo in it, and you can do this as many times as you can. But sometimes it says excessive use of transformation device places a heavy burden on the body, please try again later, so after about 10 or 20 seconds later, give another try, you will transform into an insect. And then transform back into the normal form, and enjoy the flare drops. By the way, this is a glitch so by the time you're watching this video, this glitch may or may not be working, so it's not 100% guaranteed that this glitch will work, but I will keep it updated in the comment section, and when you turn into an insect, you will get a tiny rocket launcher, or whatever that weapon is called, and you can shoot an unlimited amount of bullets, but it doesn't really deal that much damage when you're shooting a normal human player. It does like 5% damage, and sometimes 10% when you headshot them, so it's kind of useless shooting at normal human players since it doesn't deal good amount of damage. But when you're fighting against other insect players, your rocket launcher will track the enemy, and deals a really good amount of damage, it takes on average two shots to kill them. But the most annoying part is that, shooting at these tiny enemies, or insects is really really hard, I mean I miss all my bullets, because these insects are so tiny, and also I think that aim assist doesn't work on the insects, so it's gonna be even harder to kill the insect player, unless you become one yourself. So I would recommend using explosives such as grenades, as they are more effective to kill the insectoids. And also you can use a gas can explosion to kill insectoids, bait them into coming near a fuel can, and blow it up, it will deal a huge amount of damage to the tiny insects. And also the spawn rate of the pans and labs are very high, so you can use those to hit the insects, and one single hit with a pan will kill the insectoid, so if you are an insectoid stay away as possible from pans, and now to the teleportation, you can teleport through a portal from one lab to another lab, but only possible when you're an insectoid, or tiny insect. And when you become an insect, or insectoid you can collect some dust particles, or the luminator, which you can use them later, to buy stuff from the luminator shop, you can buy armor, health, guns as well as air drop weapons and a lot of stuff. If you go out from the lab while being an insect form, you will see a red zone, it kinda looks similar to blue zone, but it's actually a quantum field, if you cross that area, you will lose your ability to maintain the insectoid form. And after 10 seconds you will turn back into the normal human form, if you're flying too high you might fall down, and die due to the fall damage, so be careful of that. So you gotta remember few things, the lab will stop working, if you're in a blue zone, you can transform yourself into an insectoid north teleport, so the lab stops working in blue zone, and use explosives such as grenades, gas cans are the pan to kill insectoid enemies it's much easier, and lastly the unlimited flare ammo trick, not just works with flare guns, it works with almost any weapon. By the way, follow me on my Instagram, I will be posting short videos on it. Anyway, that's all I got for this video, I hope you learned something new, if you did hit the like button, and subscribe for more upcoming videos like these, see you guys in the next one.\"}, {'prompt': '', 'completion': \" Welcome guys! In this video I will give you 20 amazing tips and tricks that you need to know and they may help you. So let's get started! Moving Vehicle Seat Swap! When you see an enemy while you're driving vehicle, you can swap your seat and star shooting. By doing this, you may lose some of your critical accuracy, but it's still better than jumping from a moving vehicle and losing 80% of health. You may need to be careful while doing this because your vehicle will hit the brake when you swap seats and eventually stops moving, which makes easier for enemies to kill you. So it's better to get down from the vehicle and find a cover. Speaking of cover, you can use your vehicle as cover in some situations. But there's a gap between tires from this gap you can get shots, so it's better to burst the tires and use the vehicle as cover. Now I think you might be safe from getting shots from below the vehicle. This vehicle is still usable, but not as fast as before. And also this depends on vehicles. Make sure you only burst two tires on the same side or it might be tough for you to travel. Or sometimes you don't need to burst the tires, it depends on the situation. You can kill people by shooting from below the object, like a fake car in boot camp, or in military base bridge and many more. This trick works only when legs are visible. So yeah, you should be careful while camping behind objects like these. Do you know that painkillers wait the same amount as the first aid kit in your backpack? Do you think the first aid kit will be much heavier? But the painkiller is quite heavy in your bag. Painkiller is worse boost item in my opinion because it takes up a lot of space in your bag and extremely long to use and also not very efficient. I recommend carrying energy drinks because you can take two energy drinks and it doesn't take as much space in your bag as a painkiller and gives you a little bit more boost than a single painkiller. There are actually two ways of crossing this river near a boot camp, one is from water and another one is using a bridge. You can cross this river by swimming underwater, speaking of underwater you can stay up to 18 to 20 seconds underwater and sometimes you can make it without losing health, sometimes you may lose some health. So swimming underwater is safe and harder for enemies to spot you in water. If you get knocked in the water you'll die instantly, so be careful while traveling from water or while crossing rivers. There is a jump near a boot camp that you can easily do with a bike but with a scooter, maybe you can make halfway through and swim. If you ever made this jump with scooter, then let me know in comments. Most people don't like using a bike because it can easily get flipped but the bike is the fastest vehicle and also a less secured vehicle. You can balance the bike with those up-down controls, so in case if you ever need to use bike use those to control or balance the bike from getting flipped, just like in hill climb racing. Moving while healing is extremely helpful, I think most players know this by now. If you played for more than one season you will get used to moving while healing, it just saves your life if any shots are coming in and make it hard for enemies to shoot at you. And the next tip is for gyroscope players only. Having a different sensitivity for sniping and spraying is really helpful. Change your sensitivity when you want to snip and change it back to normal after. This may be hard at starting, but you'll get used to it. If a bike is about game mechanics, your right peak actually exposes less of your body, then left peak does. It's basically the way the character model works, left peak is going to reveal more of your body means bigger hitbox and more chances of getting hit than if you right peak. And also right peak gives you more field of view, then left peak. You're not saying that never use left peak in certain cases you should do it because it's the only choice, but keep in mind your body exposes a lot when you left peak. Do yourself a favor by having the same weapons in the same slot every time? Let's say you're carrying M4 and a sniper and you have M4 and slot 1 and sniper and slot 2. In that way whenever you want to snipe someone, you will know sniper is in slot 2 and also it gives you muscle memory to understand easier. Whenever you want to spray down enemies from 100 meters or higher, try to use crouch and spray. By crouching your recoil will be reduced a little bit and increases your accuracy. So try to crouch more often to get used to doing it regularly. And if you can't able to control recoil and enemy is so far, then you prone and start shooting, by using prone, your recoil will be reduced almost half, I think so, and it will be harder for enemies to shoot back at you because of smaller hitbox. And maybe sometimes crouching and pruning might be useful in the close range too. You can easily survive all of the zones up to above 5, that's when you should probably think about getting in but when you get stuck in the gun fights in zones like 2, 3 or maybe 4, it's not a good idea of fighting in the blue zone, but with enough health kits and full boost, you can definitely outlive your opponents, there are gonna move or they gonna die under the blue zone. And you could stay safe or at least alive, but by 5th zone, you should be getting in. Whenever you are trying to do the third party to someone, if you see someone not just confirm those kills, you'll get those kills, not the enemy who not them, it's like stealing kills, but worth it because you are getting free kills by stealing their kills. Cooking those nades is probably one of the most important things to learn, however, you want to learn it either going training grounds or count in your head and getting lucky, if I start throwing nades behind that house, those guys will have plenty of time to get away, however, if I cook it perfectly, and this guy will die and not stand a chance of getting out. So do yourself a favor by getting really good at cooking these nades because they make you a better player. And next thing is pre-fire, pre-fire plays an important role whenever you want to push, do it with a pre-fire it always helps and do it more often to get good at it. The more you play the more common hiding spots you know. If you have intel on someone's position you should pre-fire obviously since you are already putting shots down range and the person is still reacting. On defense pre-fire as well, when attackers try to push an object it will make them hesitate or slow down and cancel out their peeker's advantage. If you don't have intel of someone being in a room but you are still clearing it, just quick peek the room look for someone, and if you do see someone pre-fire on the re-peak. Otherwise, just quick peek and pre-aim every angle as you go. I wouldn't worry too much about giving away your position since most people know what's going on without having confirmed intel. Most people check everything anyways. Having more than three smoke grenades will definitely help you in the final circle. When you want to loot a crate during an open battlefield, use smokes. When you want to rush into a building from open ground, use smokes. When you want to make enemies full with a fake grenade, use smokes. So here in my case, I'm rushing in the open field and I use few smokes to give me good a cover and distract them. Try to use the highest sound settings for headphones or earphones, which makes easier for you to listen to enemies footsteps and locate them easily. Gun sounds will be loud at starting, but if you keep on playing on highest sound settings you'll get used to it. And finally having a great game sense, for example, some people who are new to the game will prone in the grass, thinking that they are safe and covered up by all the grass, well they don't understand that grass only renders about few hunters of meters, so my enemy is almost 100 meters away. And he thinks that proning in the grass is safe, but from my angle, I cannot see any grass because it does not render that far. So how to improve your game sense? Well by playing and understanding how game works, the more time you spend on the game, will increase your game sense, and also try to watch some e-sports, which will give you some more details about game sense, and how pro players play.

Bye bye.\"}, {'prompt': '', 'completion': \" J.CF is short for Hugando Conforza, which is Spanish for playing with force, but is also play on words because my character's name is Forza. So I'm playing with Forza. After helping develop the Battle Royale concept for games like Armour and H1Z1, Brendan Green, known by his alias player unknown, was hired as a creative developer at Bluehole to realize his vision for the genre in his game Player Unknown's Battleground, which exploded into and is still currently considered the defining game of the genre, even though later Fortnite used 3-to-play concepts to surpass it in size and income. Today I'm going to give you 151 tips and tricks for PUBG. When you first sign up, you will be given the chance to choose a name and customize a character. A lot of players will tell you that the female character has a smaller hitbox and therefore gives you a tactical advantage, but the developers of the game have clarified that even though the girl character is smaller than the guy, the hitboxes are identical. Upon hearing this, some players will still push back saying that there might be a tactical advantage in choosing a girl because she is smaller and therefore harder to see, but since 99% of finding someone has to do with noise and camouflage levels, which are also identical between genders, these claims are at-fess and significant. After choosing your character, you will be brought to the menu screen. Before getting started, I recommend clicking on the settings button here to customize a few things. On the basic tab, enabling Amuses lets the game move the crosshairs for you a little bit, which I personally like, but it is not always helpful because enemies don't always move in the direction the game anticipates, which in those instances it can actually throw you off. Using the release option on these different firing modes gives you more precision when firing, but it also takes a while to get used to it, so I wouldn't recommend doing that unless you're an advanced player. I strongly recommend enabling peak and fire even if you're a new player because this is something you want to get good at eventually, but I wouldn't recommend selecting the whole to lean unless you're an advanced player. I keep all the other settings in this tab on their default, but it is important to note that auto-open doors can cause you to accidentally open a door at the wrong time, alerting nearby enemies to your location. In the graphics tab, setting the style the colorful will increase contrast and make it easier to see other players, and selecting a high frame rate will give your reaction time a slight advantage. This makes graphics the least important setting in this tab so it just it based on what your phone can handle. Since I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S7, which is becoming an older phone, I keep my graphics on the lowest possible setting and I keep all the other settings on default. In the controls tab, I recommend clicking the Customize button and adjusting your peak and fire buttons to be a little bit closer so you don't have to extend your thumb so far. I also recommend reducing the distance of the sprint button just a little bit and moving all of these buttons here on the right just a little bit closer to each other. Those are my favorite settings, but ultimately you need to find what works best for you. If you want to experiment with something, I recommend first trying it out in a new layout so that you can revert back to your old customized settings if you don't like it. You'll notice in my third layout that I have my shooting buttons at the top of my screen, because I bought these cool little trigger things for three bucks online from some company in China. I'm still getting the hang of them, but once I figure them out, I think having those two extra fingers will be a game changer. So if you want to try them, I'll put links to where to buy them in the description. I recommend disabling auto pickup because once you know what you're doing, it usually slows you down or crowds up your inventory. I keep all the settings on the other tabs at their default, but after you've been playing for a while, you might want to browse through them to see if you want to adjust anything. Now that we've talked about settings, let me touch briefly on the menu screen. You can customize all your game settings here, including perspective, server, modes, maps, teams, etc. Whatever you set here will be remembered and you will use those settings every time you click start. You can add friends by clicking on this button and then selecting the Add Friend tab and then typing your friend's name or character ID in this search bar. You can then invite those friends into your party using this button, but if you don't have any friends, the game will automatically select teammates for you. Joining a clan is a great way to find friends and forming a crew makes it easy to find your closest friends quickly. After you've played a few games, I recommend spending some time in the armory. The armory lets you see the stats on every single gun in the game and how that gun interacts with the various mods you can find for it. This is incredibly helpful for knowing which gun you want to keep on the battlefield. If you're free to play gamer, there are only two parts of the shop that apply to you. First one is the soldier crate. You can be bought for battle points which you get from logging in and playing the game. Missions for getting these points are either reset daily or weekly on Sunday at 6pm central standard time, which is also when the soldier crate price resets. The second one is the redeemed section. These items can be bought with the tokens you get for dismantling clothing duplicates. If you are not a free to play player, the best way to support the devs is to buy one of these elite season passes because they offer more rewards per dollar than any other offer. All of these other tabs are either not important at all or you will see a red dot when they do become important. So when you have everything set up the way you want it, click start. If you're playing on a team, the most important thing you can do is communicate with your teammates. In addition to an in game chat system, PUBG has implemented several ways to help a team communicate and work together. The first way is accessible by clicking on the mini map, this will pull up a bigger map. By clicking anywhere on this map, it will automatically set a marker that you and your teammates can see. This is helpful for a lot of reasons, but the most common thing this is used for is telling your teammates where you want to go. You can also click on this tab here which allows you to follow a teammate or invite them to follow you. This makes it really easy for your team to end up in the same place and reduces your chance of miscommunication. Lastly, if you do not want to use the voice chat, you can click the dialog button here, which gives you a ton of communication options. Some of these options have further meaning based on what you are pointing at when you use them. These in vehicles on the map are randomized each time you play, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't pay attention to where you got something, because certain places are more likely to give better weapons than others. If you get really familiar with an area, you will have a huge upper hand on someone that is just wandering around aimlessly. As a general rule, these areas have more and better loot, but most players know that, so they tend to be more heavily sought after. If you are playing a solo game, I strongly recommend avoiding these places if they are close to where the plane enters the map. All of the players are in the exact same plane as you, and most players have a tendency to exit the plane earlier. You can see which players have exited the plane by this number right here. If you are a confident player, I recommend finding one of these good locations that is off the path and marking it on your map. The maximum distance you can travel after jumping out of the plane is around 1500 meters. Some players will tell you that you can extend this distance by opening up your parachute early or slowing down your movement speed, but this is not true for PUBG Mobile, and using this approach just delays how fast you get weapons. If you are a less confident player, I recommend doing the same thing with one of these smaller groups of buildings that is off the path. There is no inertia in the game, so as soon as you jump off the plane, you can travel the opposite way of the plane just as far as if you were going with it. But I don't recommend doing that because other players that got off the plane earlier will get to the same destination faster than you, which means they will probably have guns by the time you land. As I mentioned earlier, the items are randomized, but if you find a location that has a lot of great stuff, it will probably have a lot of great stuff every time you go there. So if you are pretty new to the game, I recommend going to the same place as much as you can to get really familiar with it, which will give you a huge advantage over other players that aren't as familiar with that area. After the plane leaves the island, a safe zone will appear. It will be a circle covering about a third of the island, and a timer will start with 5 minutes. When this timer runs out, a radiation zone will start closing in on that circle. The radiation zone wall moves slower or faster, based on how far it is to the closest edge of the new circle. This means that if you are far away from the circle, the radiation zone travels significantly faster than you can run. The process of the radiation zone shrinking the first time also takes exactly 5 minutes. At this point, a new safe zone appears, and the process repeats itself for a total of 9 phases. Here are the main stats on each of these phases. For those of you who have been playing for a while, these numbers may not seem that important, but now that you know them, you will be surprised how often this knowledge will affect your decisions. Knowing details about what is going on around you in a game can often increase confidence and reduce indecisiveness. In the beginning, you don't have to worry that much about the radiation zone because it only does 0.4 damage per second. But this damage increases each round, so by the time you get to the end of the game, the radiation zone does 11 damage per second, which makes it incredibly important to be in the safe zone. For those of you who are used to playing rules of survival where you can spend the first half of the game in the radiation zone, you will find this much more difficult to do in PUBG. As soon as you land, find a gun with ammo as quickly as possible. People can tell when you don't have a gun and they will chase you mercilessly until you are dead. Once you have a gun, I recommend searching for a rifle and ammo. SMGs are a much better option than they were in rules of survival, but having a rifle is one of your weapons is still really important. Even what your average bullet per kill ratio is, and then unless you have a really nice backpack stop gathering ammo after you have enough to kill 8 people. I promise that by the time you've killed those 8 people you will have found more ammo. If you see the shooting icon, don't assume they're shooting at you, but look around to see if you can find them. If you see them and they don't see you, don't attack them unless it's an easy kill. Long battles attract a lot of attention and should be avoided. Stay near buildings so that if you start taking damage and you don't see them, you can just run around a corner to buy you some time and set up if they chase you. Now if you're still in bronze, most of the players you will be fighting are AI players, which are really easy to kill. Do not let this easy competition make you develop bad habits. Try to always fight from a position where you have cover and if you don't have cover, try to get in the habit of moving while you shoot so that you do not become an easy target. Even if the player you're shooting does not see you start moving within 2 seconds after first firing your gun because if you shoot at someone while you are not in cover, it will likely attract the attention of someone else nearby and standing in the middle of the field will get you killed really quickly. So get in the habit of moving while you shoot every time you engage when you don't have cover to hide behind. If you're playing a team game, the most important thing you can do in the very early stage is stay close enough to your teammates so that you can support each other while you're looking for items. If you're playing competitively then you should have a good team and if you have a good team, then you should live or die as a team. Playing 3 vs 4 in a competitive game is stupid, especially because it's so easy to avoid. You also want to be on the lookout for good armor, helmets and backpacks. Level 3 items are the best in the game but they are also rare. Level 2 items are attainable but don't spend too much time trying to get all level 2 pieces. You can see what level your gear is from how many bars are here. Once you have some decent gear, you have several options on what to do next. PUBG is a multifaceted game. You get points for killing people, doing damage, getting supplies, surviving the longest and even get points for taking damage and then healing yourself. This gives you lots of options on how to play this game. If you want to know the 4 main strategies for how people play PUBG, I recommend checking out my video that lays out the pros and cons of all 4 of them. The only tactic that I don't mention in that video is the car rampage tactic. Using a car is your weapon is very effective. So much so that there are some players that are able to win solo games without ever shooting a gun. That tactic is a great option as is all the tactics I mentioned in that video and if you're going for points you should do whichever one best fits your strengths as a player. But in this video I'm going to be focusing on how to get first place. PUBG is not just a shooter game. You can be fun to play it that way and you still get lots of points doing it but if you want to get first place often you have to get out of that mentality. PUBG is also a survival game. Shooting a gun attracts attention and attention is a great way to die. If I see someone and they don't see me but I'm not in a good enough position to kill them and take on someone else that hears me kill them I just let them go. In fact if I'm really playing competitive like I'm trying to get first place every time I often just watch people for most of the game and only kill when I really have a good read on where everyone is at. The best place to hide is in tall grass on high ground near a rock or tree. For those of you who saw my rules of survival video my tactic where I hide in one of these little sheds with a shotgun is not nearly as effective in PUBG because it's not as easy to one shot someone so I seldom use this tactic when I'm playing PUBG. I still love using shotguns and I see a lot of pros use them in urban combat but I don't use the shed tactic. Now when you're part of a team there's no reason to hide because a well-positioned team that works well together can kill dozens of players without ever receiving a single casualty. The team simply has to make sure that they position themselves in a place that they can fight in any direction with little to moderate repositioning. They also need to make sure that they are close enough to each other that they can revive downed enemies without being exposed. The team that works well together under those conditions is almost invincible. A solo person however is not especially in PUBG. A lot of players are really good with a car 98 so drawing too much attention can be the end even if you're a really good player. If you are pushing hard for the first place position I recommend using one of these two tactics. If you find that you are already in the new safe zone when it appears I recommend staying in your hiding place for as long as you can. Look around to see where people are but don't kill anyone unless you are confident that you can kill them within 2 seconds of first firing your gun. Look at them if they are close but be super wary of other enemies since you just fired your gun. Even firing a gun with a suppressor will still alert enemies if they are close enough. In a team game if you shoot someone and they die without getting knocked down first then that means that all of their teammates are already dead. But if they get knocked down first instead of dying that means that at least one of their teammates is still alive and the guy you just knocked down can communicate your position to his teammates even after you kill him. So you want to kill him as soon as possible so his teammates don't revive him but you also want to be cautious when it happens and stick close to your teammates. It is incredibly hard for someone to see you when you are crawling in the grass if you are on high ground. But if you are on lower ground than them high grass is almost worthless. If you are on high ground and stay still people should not be able to see you unless you are within 7 meters or closer. If you find yourself outside of the new safe zone when it appears I recommend waiting as long as possible. You can run from cover to cover if you are careful to look around while you do it but I recommend giving other players a chance to get to the safe zone first. This might seem like horrible advice because a lot of players talk about killing people as they run to the safe zone but once you try it a couple times you will notice that that happens rarely. In PUBG most players die when an enemy notices them first. That enemy then fires at them when they are in bad position and they have very little chance of winning the fight. By letting other players go first you will find that you often see other players before they see you. In fact most of them will never see you because their back is turned to you most of the time as they run to safety. Usually by the end everyone is calling around at a field and behind cover and it is very hard to see them. If you are part of a team and there are no buildings in the safe zone I recommend spreading out about 4 to 8 meters from each other. This makes you close enough to support each other but far enough away that enemies will probably only see one of you at a time. If you are playing solo stay hidden as long as possible. Remember this tutorial is about getting first place so ideally you only have to kill one person to win but the closer you get to the end the harder it is to not run into someone. When you see someone get close kill them while you still have the advantage of shooting first then slowly crawl away from your kill while looking around because the loot box is noticeable from a distance and your enemies will likely be looking for you to loot your kill. When you are down to the last two the safe zone is usually pretty small right now. I am not very good at throwing grenades so I have usually saved up about 5 or more grenades at this point. If you see the other guy but they are in cover chunk all of your grenades at them. Remember to wait a second or two before throwing it so they don't have as much time to run away but obviously don't wait 3 seconds or you will be giving them an easy win. Even the more likely scenario you do not see them but the safe zone is very small I recommend throwing one of your grenades at every tree and rock that is in the safe zone. This is kind of a controversial tactic because if they are close enough they can hear you pull the pin on your grenade and if they are watching they will either see you or the grenade in the air which will let them get an idea for where you are at. And I agree with those objections in theory but in practice I find that this tactic almost always works out to your favorite because the grenades usually get people to come out of their cover or reveal where they are and I only do this when I have a really good position. So in my experience it either works or they weren't in cover because they were crawling on the grass and it doesn't seem to have an effect either way. So I recommend trying it out for yourself and see if you can land the first place spot. In addition to those 99 tips and tricks I have 52 more for you. There seems to be a lot of confusion even among advanced players on how boost items work. I hear a lot of people say that energy drinks give you movement speed but painkillers do not. That is not true. Energy items do not give you any benefits in and of themselves. Rather they give you points towards your boost meter and your boost meter gives you benefits. It's important to think this way because if you don't you will get confused. There are very advanced websites out there that say things like energy drinks will restore 23% of your health. That is not true. If you use an energy drink well it can heal up to 52% of your health. Here's how the boost system works. When you use a boost item it gives you a percentage of your boost meter which diminishes over time. This meter consists of a total of 5 minutes. Energy drinks give you 40% of that meter which is equal to 2 minutes. Energy drinks will give you 60% which is equal to 3 minutes and the adrenaline syringe gives you 100% which covers the whole 5 minutes. You get different benefits based on how much boost you have in your boost meter. So using an energy drink by itself actually only heals 22% of your health. But that is not the best way to use an energy drink. If you use a painkiller and then an energy drink that same energy drink will heal 52% of your health and give you a move in speed bonus of either 2.5 or 6.2% based on which bar you are on. And then after 2 minutes when your bar drops back down to 60%. You can use another energy drink to get another 52% of your health back and have another move in speed bonus. So that's how the boost system works in PUBG. If you want to know more about my strategy on how to maximize this system to your advantage be sure to check out my video titled How to get double healing from energy drinks. To just recently added the flare gun into the game you need to aim towards the sky in order to use it. Using it outside the safe zone will spawn an armored vehicle and using it inside the safe zone will spawn a special air drop with twice the normal loot. The developers never actually added infrastructure to these towers so you cannot land on them no matter how hard you try. But there is a way to use the lean function to get a little bit up this tower. While clearing a house or going around a corner you can use your third person camera to peek around the other side which is an effective way to stay safe while scouting. While driving a vehicle you can see its health and fuel bar shown here. You can also tell when one of your tires has been destroyed because the corresponding icon will turn red. Peek as much as you can even when you're in a house but remember that staying inside a house can sometimes become a death trap if you are up against a player who is skilled with grenades. While shooting through a window or any small hole you will notice that you do not always shoot where your crosshairs are. Remember to leave more space below your aim so that you don't hit the wall in front of you while you are shooting. Short grass will actually disappear once you are more than 150 meters away from the grass so don't try to hide in short grass. Zooming in doesn't just magnify it allows you to see as if you were actually closer. So some players will appear that weren't previously visible. Unlike most other shooter games PUBG has implemented a bullet drop for every gun so remember to aim high when trying to shoot longer range shots. Especially on guns that do not have a high range stat. This is again where the armory is particularly helpful. If you unequip all your weapons you can run much faster. If you do this your character will move 6.3 meters per second so that's a good way to measure how long it will take you to reach the safe zone. If you're too far from the circle try to look for a vehicle. You can usually find them along roads. You can use downed enemies as bait to get their teammates to come try to revive them but make sure you kill them before they reach cover. I personally like to put all of my guns on single fire mode. I find that the extra headshots more than make up for the slow rate of fire. If the safe zone covers the outer sea you can swim away from the shore and survive a really long time but doing this will probably make it more difficult to get first place because you have to get back to shore before you can fire your gun. You can't heal beyond 75% health level except when you are using med kits, energy drinks, pills or the adrenaline syringe. While the crossbow and pubg looks awesome and it can one shot an unarmored enemy even with a body shot which can sometimes make it useful in the initial scramble it is actually a terrible weapon. It has a long reloading time and you get one shot at a time. The only thing that's good about this weapon is that it makes absolutely no noise. Always choose a pan over other melee weapons it has higher damage and it can block bullets. I know this is a tip for doing better at the game but I strongly recommend checking out the Viva Lidert League YouTube channel. I'm pretty busy with work and family and I don't have time to watch a lot of YouTube channels but I watch and like every single pubgie video these guys make and several of their other series. Just watch this one video from them and then when you fall in love with them remember that JCF was the one that sent you. Smoke grenades are useful for reviving a teammate or repositioning but remember to throw them quite a bit in front of the area that you were trying to cover because they don't cover the area immediately near where they land. Please pay attention to your mini map even when you're using a scope to see where your enemy is shooting from. Audio is really important this game since a lot of noises like opening doors, looting, healing, pulling the pen on a grenade, a thrown grenade and most footsteps do not give these notifications. If you are wanting to play competitively I recommend using a good headset so that you not only hear those noises but a good headset will help you identify where those noises are coming from. Here you have full health before getting into a fight and using painkillers and boost right before engaging an enemy is a great way to give yourself an advantage in a fight especially at the end of the game when options are the most limited. Wearing darker clothes like black shirt, black pants etc is best for the main map, airing out but they make you easier to spot in Miramar. Natural colors like yellow and gray are the best if you want to play on that map. Like I said earlier I almost always put my weapons on single shot but this is especially important if you are trying to shoot someone from far away because the recoil of the gun is magnified the further distance you shoot. When you are parachuting down use the eye icon to see how many players and teams are dropping at the same place as you. After you kill someone don't just stand there and loot their body that's a great way to get snipe. Just grab what you can within one second and then get out. When you get shot at never ever ever start crawling or crouching. This is a very common new mistake. Having and crawling is helpful for hiding behind cover and not getting notice in the first place. They actually make you an easier target because they make you go slower. Always use the left fire button when using a scope because you will need your right thumb to aim. When you want to show your teammate where an enemy is at just move your crosshair over the enemy and then click the enemy ahead dialogue in the chat. Having scopes with higher magnification is always more useful than a lower one but do not equip a six time scope or higher on both of your items or it will severely weaken your close quarter combat. Moving silently in PUBG is a lot more difficult than rules of survival. So if you are playing a solo game I don't recommend staying too long in buildings. Using the boost option for vehicles requires a lot more gas and creates more noise so I don't recommend using it unless you are getting shot at or trying to outrun the radiation zone. When there are only two people in a car sit on the same side so the driver can position the car as a shield in combat. While you are swimming pay attention to your lung function. If it is turning red that means the game is thinking that you are still submerged in water even though your character looks like it's not. Pressing crouch will let you submerge into water and jump will allow you to surface. If you are trying to get to the safe zone or escape an enemy fire by swimming submerging is a great way to increase your safety. Bullets can penetrate water but the damage is significantly reduced. You are also obviously harder to spot when you are underwater. And then lastly if you are pretty new to the game I recommend avoiding motorcycles because they can be pretty difficult to master and it is much easier for other enemies to kill you. Well that's it guys hope that helps. Obviously compiling that was a lot of work so please remember to like this video if you did in fact like this video and if you liked it a lot can you please share it on your Facebook and Discord groups so that more people can see it. JCF is a pretty new channel and it really helps me grow. Alright guys I'll see you next time.\"}]\n"

            "[' J', \"CF is short for Hugando Conforza, which is Spanish for playing with force, but is also play on words because my character's name is Forza\", \" So I'm playing with Forza\", \" After helping develop the Battle Royale concept for games like Armour and H1Z1, Brendan Green, known by his alias player unknown, was hired as a creative developer at Bluehole to realize his vision for the genre in his game Player Unknown's Battleground, which exploded into and is still currently considered the defining game of the genre, even though later Fortnite used 3-to-play concepts to surpass it in size and income\", \" Today I'm going to give you 151 tips and tricks for PUBG\", ' When you first sign up, you will be given the chance to choose a name and customize a character', ' A lot of players will tell you that the female character has a smaller hitbox and therefore gives you a tactical advantage, but the developers of the game have clarified that even though the girl character is smaller than the guy, the hitboxes are identical', ' Upon hearing this, some players will still push back saying that there might be a tactical advantage in choosing a girl because she is smaller and therefore harder to see, but since 99% of finding someone has to do with noise and camouflage levels, which are also identical between genders, these claims are at-fess and significant', ' After choosing your character, you will be brought to the menu screen', ' Before getting started, I recommend clicking on the settings button here to customize a few things', \" On the basic tab, enabling Amuses lets the game move the crosshairs for you a little bit, which I personally like, but it is not always helpful because enemies don't always move in the direction the game anticipates, which in those instances it can actually throw you off\", \" Using the release option on these different firing modes gives you more precision when firing, but it also takes a while to get used to it, so I wouldn't recommend doing that unless you're an advanced player\", \" I strongly recommend enabling peak and fire even if you're a new player because this is something you want to get good at eventually, but I wouldn't recommend selecting the whole to lean unless you're an advanced player\", ' I keep all the other settings in this tab on their default, but it is important to note that auto-open doors can cause you to accidentally open a door at the wrong time, alerting nearby enemies to your location', ' In the graphics tab, setting the style the colorful will increase contrast and make it easier to see other players, and selecting a high frame rate will give your reaction time a slight advantage', ' This makes graphics the least important setting in this tab so it just it based on what your phone can handle', \" Since I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S7, which is becoming an older phone, I keep my graphics on the lowest possible setting and I keep all the other settings on default\", \" In the controls tab, I recommend clicking the Customize button and adjusting your peak and fire buttons to be a little bit closer so you don't have to extend your thumb so far\", ' I also recommend reducing the distance of the sprint button just a little bit and moving all of these buttons here on the right just a little bit closer to each other', ' Those are my favorite settings, but ultimately you need to find what works best for you', \" If you want to experiment with something, I recommend first trying it out in a new layout so that you can revert back to your old customized settings if you don't like it\", \" You'll notice in my third layout that I have my shooting buttons at the top of my screen, because I bought these cool little trigger things for three bucks online from some company in China\", \" I'm still getting the hang of them, but once I figure them out, I think having those two extra fingers will be a game changer\", \" So if you want to try them, I'll put links to where to buy them in the description\", \" I recommend disabling auto pickup because once you know what you're doing, it usually slows you down or crowds up your inventory\", \" I keep all the settings on the other tabs at their default, but after you've been playing for a while, you might want to browse through them to see if you want to adjust anything\", \" Now that we've talked about settings, let me touch briefly on the menu screen\", ' You can customize all your game settings here, including perspective, server, modes, maps, teams, etc', ' Whatever you set here will be remembered and you will use those settings every time you click start', \" You can add friends by clicking on this button and then selecting the Add Friend tab and then typing your friend's name or character ID in this search bar\", \" You can then invite those friends into your party using this button, but if you don't have any friends, the game will automatically select teammates for you\", ' Joining a clan is a great way to find friends and forming a crew makes it easy to find your closest friends quickly', \" After you've played a few games, I recommend spending some time in the armory\", ' The armory lets you see the stats on every single gun in the game and how that gun interacts with the various mods you can find for it', ' This is incredibly helpful for knowing which gun you want to keep on the battlefield', \" If you're free to play gamer, there are only two parts of the shop that apply to you\", ' First one is the soldier crate', ' You can be bought for battle points which you get from logging in and playing the game', ' Missions for getting these points are either reset daily or weekly on Sunday at 6pm central standard time, which is also when the soldier crate price resets', ' The second one is the redeemed section', ' These items can be bought with the tokens you get for dismantling clothing duplicates', ' If you are not a free to play player, the best way to support the devs is to buy one of these elite season passes because they offer more rewards per dollar than any other offer', ' All of these other tabs are either not important at all or you will see a red dot when they do become important', ' So when you have everything set up the way you want it, click start', \" If you're playing on a team, the most important thing you can do is communicate with your teammates\", ' In addition to an in game chat system, PUBG has implemented several ways to help a team communicate and work together', ' The first way is accessible by clicking on the mini map, this will pull up a bigger map', ' By clicking anywhere on this map, it will automatically set a marker that you and your teammates can see', ' This is helpful for a lot of reasons, but the most common thing this is used for is telling your teammates where you want to go', ' You can also click on this tab here which allows you to follow a teammate or invite them to follow you', ' This makes it really easy for your team to end up in the same place and reduces your chance of miscommunication', ' Lastly, if you do not want to use the voice chat, you can click the dialog button here, which gives you a ton of communication options', ' Some of these options have further meaning based on what you are pointing at when you use them', \" These in vehicles on the map are randomized each time you play, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't pay attention to where you got something, because certain places are more likely to give better weapons than others\", ' If you get really familiar with an area, you will have a huge upper hand on someone that is just wandering around aimlessly', ' As a general rule, these areas have more and better loot, but most players know that, so they tend to be more heavily sought after', ' If you are playing a solo game, I strongly recommend avoiding these places if they are close to where the plane enters the map', ' All of the players are in the exact same plane as you, and most players have a tendency to exit the plane earlier', ' You can see which players have exited the plane by this number right here', ' If you are a confident player, I recommend finding one of these good locations that is off the path and marking it on your map', ' The maximum distance you can travel after jumping out of the plane is around 1500 meters', ' Some players will tell you that you can extend this distance by opening up your parachute early or slowing down your movement speed, but this is not true for PUBG Mobile, and using this approach just delays how fast you get weapons', ' If you are a less confident player, I recommend doing the same thing with one of these smaller groups of buildings that is off the path', ' There is no inertia in the game, so as soon as you jump off the plane, you can travel the opposite way of the plane just as far as if you were going with it', \" But I don't recommend doing that because other players that got off the plane earlier will get to the same destination faster than you, which means they will probably have guns by the time you land\", ' As I mentioned earlier, the items are randomized, but if you find a location that has a lot of great stuff, it will probably have a lot of great stuff every time you go there', \" So if you are pretty new to the game, I recommend going to the same place as much as you can to get really familiar with it, which will give you a huge advantage over other players that aren't as familiar with that area\", ' After the plane leaves the island, a safe zone will appear', ' It will be a circle covering about a third of the island, and a timer will start with 5 minutes', ' When this timer runs out, a radiation zone will start closing in on that circle', ' The radiation zone wall moves slower or faster, based on how far it is to the closest edge of the new circle', ' This means that if you are far away from the circle, the radiation zone travels significantly faster than you can run', ' The process of the radiation zone shrinking the first time also takes exactly 5 minutes', ' At this point, a new safe zone appears, and the process repeats itself for a total of 9 phases', ' Here are the main stats on each of these phases', ' For those of you who have been playing for a while, these numbers may not seem that important, but now that you know them, you will be surprised how often this knowledge will affect your decisions', ' Knowing details about what is going on around you in a game can often increase confidence and reduce indecisiveness', \" In the beginning, you don't have to worry that much about the radiation zone because it only does 0\", '4 damage per second', ' But this damage increases each round, so by the time you get to the end of the game, the radiation zone does 11 damage per second, which makes it incredibly important to be in the safe zone', ' For those of you who are used to playing rules of survival where you can spend the first half of the game in the radiation zone, you will find this much more difficult to do in PUBG', ' As soon as you land, find a gun with ammo as quickly as possible', \" People can tell when you don't have a gun and they will chase you mercilessly until you are dead\", ' Once you have a gun, I recommend searching for a rifle and ammo', ' SMGs are a much better option than they were in rules of survival, but having a rifle is one of your weapons is still really important', ' Even what your average bullet per kill ratio is, and then unless you have a really nice backpack stop gathering ammo after you have enough to kill 8 people', \" I promise that by the time you've killed those 8 people you will have found more ammo\", \" If you see the shooting icon, don't assume they're shooting at you, but look around to see if you can find them\", \" If you see them and they don't see you, don't attack them unless it's an easy kill\", ' Long battles attract a lot of attention and should be avoided', \" Stay near buildings so that if you start taking damage and you don't see them, you can just run around a corner to buy you some time and set up if they chase you\", \" Now if you're still in bronze, most of the players you will be fighting are AI players, which are really easy to kill\", ' Do not let this easy competition make you develop bad habits', \" Try to always fight from a position where you have cover and if you don't have cover, try to get in the habit of moving while you shoot so that you do not become an easy target\", \" Even if the player you're shooting does not see you start moving within 2 seconds after first firing your gun because if you shoot at someone while you are not in cover, it will likely attract the attention of someone else nearby and standing in the middle of the field will get you killed really quickly\", \" So get in the habit of moving while you shoot every time you engage when you don't have cover to hide behind\", \" If you're playing a team game, the most important thing you can do in the very early stage is stay close enough to your teammates so that you can support each other while you're looking for items\", \" If you're playing competitively then you should have a good team and if you have a good team, then you should live or die as a team\", \" Playing 3 vs 4 in a competitive game is stupid, especially because it's so easy to avoid\", ' You also want to be on the lookout for good armor, helmets and backpacks', ' Level 3 items are the best in the game but they are also rare', \" Level 2 items are attainable but don't spend too much time trying to get all level 2 pieces\", ' You can see what level your gear is from how many bars are here', ' Once you have some decent gear, you have several options on what to do next', ' PUBG is a multifaceted game', ' You get points for killing people, doing damage, getting supplies, surviving the longest and even get points for taking damage and then healing yourself', ' This gives you lots of options on how to play this game', ' If you want to know the 4 main strategies for how people play PUBG, I recommend checking out my video that lays out the pros and cons of all 4 of them', \" The only tactic that I don't mention in that video is the car rampage tactic\", ' Using a car is your weapon is very effective', ' So much so that there are some players that are able to win solo games without ever shooting a gun', \" That tactic is a great option as is all the tactics I mentioned in that video and if you're going for points you should do whichever one best fits your strengths as a player\", \" But in this video I'm going to be focusing on how to get first place\", ' PUBG is not just a shooter game', ' You can be fun to play it that way and you still get lots of points doing it but if you want to get first place often you have to get out of that mentality', ' PUBG is also a survival game', ' Shooting a gun attracts attention and attention is a great way to die', \" If I see someone and they don't see me but I'm not in a good enough position to kill them and take on someone else that hears me kill them I just let them go\", \" In fact if I'm really playing competitive like I'm trying to get first place every time I often just watch people for most of the game and only kill when I really have a good read on where everyone is at\", ' The best place to hide is in tall grass on high ground near a rock or tree', \" For those of you who saw my rules of survival video my tactic where I hide in one of these little sheds with a shotgun is not nearly as effective in PUBG because it's not as easy to one shot someone so I seldom use this tactic when I'm playing PUBG\", \" I still love using shotguns and I see a lot of pros use them in urban combat but I don't use the shed tactic\", \" Now when you're part of a team there's no reason to hide because a well-positioned team that works well together can kill dozens of players without ever receiving a single casualty\", ' The team simply has to make sure that they position themselves in a place that they can fight in any direction with little to moderate repositioning', ' They also need to make sure that they are close enough to each other that they can revive downed enemies without being exposed', ' The team that works well together under those conditions is almost invincible', ' A solo person however is not especially in PUBG', \" A lot of players are really good with a car 98 so drawing too much attention can be the end even if you're a really good player\", ' If you are pushing hard for the first place position I recommend using one of these two tactics', ' If you find that you are already in the new safe zone when it appears I recommend staying in your hiding place for as long as you can', \" Look around to see where people are but don't kill anyone unless you are confident that you can kill them within 2 seconds of first firing your gun\", ' Look at them if they are close but be super wary of other enemies since you just fired your gun', ' Even firing a gun with a suppressor will still alert enemies if they are close enough', ' In a team game if you shoot someone and they die without getting knocked down first then that means that all of their teammates are already dead', ' But if they get knocked down first instead of dying that means that at least one of their teammates is still alive and the guy you just knocked down can communicate your position to his teammates even after you kill him', \" So you want to kill him as soon as possible so his teammates don't revive him but you also want to be cautious when it happens and stick close to your teammates\", ' It is incredibly hard for someone to see you when you are crawling in the grass if you are on high ground', ' But if you are on lower ground than them high grass is almost worthless', ' If you are on high ground and stay still people should not be able to see you unless you are within 7 meters or closer', ' If you find yourself outside of the new safe zone when it appears I recommend waiting as long as possible', ' You can run from cover to cover if you are careful to look around while you do it but I recommend giving other players a chance to get to the safe zone first', ' This might seem like horrible advice because a lot of players talk about killing people as they run to the safe zone but once you try it a couple times you will notice that that happens rarely', ' In PUBG most players die when an enemy notices them first', ' That enemy then fires at them when they are in bad position and they have very little chance of winning the fight', ' By letting other players go first you will find that you often see other players before they see you', ' In fact most of them will never see you because their back is turned to you most of the time as they run to safety', ' Usually by the end everyone is calling around at a field and behind cover and it is very hard to see them', ' If you are part of a team and there are no buildings in the safe zone I recommend spreading out about 4 to 8 meters from each other', ' This makes you close enough to support each other but far enough away that enemies will probably only see one of you at a time', ' If you are playing solo stay hidden as long as possible', ' Remember this tutorial is about getting first place so ideally you only have to kill one person to win but the closer you get to the end the harder it is to not run into someone', ' When you see someone get close kill them while you still have the advantage of shooting first then slowly crawl away from your kill while looking around because the loot box is noticeable from a distance and your enemies will likely be looking for you to loot your kill', ' When you are down to the last two the safe zone is usually pretty small right now', ' I am not very good at throwing grenades so I have usually saved up about 5 or more grenades at this point', ' If you see the other guy but they are in cover chunk all of your grenades at them', \" Remember to wait a second or two before throwing it so they don't have as much time to run away but obviously don't wait 3 seconds or you will be giving them an easy win\", ' Even the more likely scenario you do not see them but the safe zone is very small I recommend throwing one of your grenades at every tree and rock that is in the safe zone', ' This is kind of a controversial tactic because if they are close enough they can hear you pull the pin on your grenade and if they are watching they will either see you or the grenade in the air which will let them get an idea for where you are at', ' And I agree with those objections in theory but in practice I find that this tactic almost always works out to your favorite because the grenades usually get people to come out of their cover or reveal where they are and I only do this when I have a really good position', \" So in my experience it either works or they weren't in cover because they were crawling on the grass and it doesn't seem to have an effect either way\", ' So I recommend trying it out for yourself and see if you can land the first place spot', ' In addition to those 99 tips and tricks I have 52 more for you', ' There seems to be a lot of confusion even among advanced players on how boost items work', ' I hear a lot of people say that energy drinks give you movement speed but painkillers do not', ' That is not true', ' Energy items do not give you any benefits in and of themselves', ' Rather they give you points towards your boost meter and your boost meter gives you benefits', \" It's important to think this way because if you don't you will get confused\", ' There are very advanced websites out there that say things like energy drinks will restore 23% of your health', ' That is not true', ' If you use an energy drink well it can heal up to 52% of your health', \" Here's how the boost system works\", ' When you use a boost item it gives you a percentage of your boost meter which diminishes over time', ' This meter consists of a total of 5 minutes', ' Energy drinks give you 40% of that meter which is equal to 2 minutes', ' Energy drinks will give you 60% which is equal to 3 minutes and the adrenaline syringe gives you 100% which covers the whole 5 minutes', ' You get different benefits based on how much boost you have in your boost meter', ' So using an energy drink by itself actually only heals 22% of your health', ' But that is not the best way to use an energy drink', ' If you use a painkiller and then an energy drink that same energy drink will heal 52% of your health and give you a move in speed bonus of either 2', '5 or 6', '2% based on which bar you are on', ' And then after 2 minutes when your bar drops back down to 60%', ' You can use another energy drink to get another 52% of your health back and have another move in speed bonus', \" So that's how the boost system works in PUBG\", ' If you want to know more about my strategy on how to maximize this system to your advantage be sure to check out my video titled How to get double healing from energy drinks', ' To just recently added the flare gun into the game you need to aim towards the sky in order to use it', ' Using it outside the safe zone will spawn an armored vehicle and using it inside the safe zone will spawn a special air drop with twice the normal loot', ' The developers never actually added infrastructure to these towers so you cannot land on them no matter how hard you try', ' But there is a way to use the lean function to get a little bit up this tower', ' While clearing a house or going around a corner you can use your third person camera to peek around the other side which is an effective way to stay safe while scouting', ' While driving a vehicle you can see its health and fuel bar shown here', ' You can also tell when one of your tires has been destroyed because the corresponding icon will turn red', \" Peek as much as you can even when you're in a house but remember that staying inside a house can sometimes become a death trap if you are up against a player who is skilled with grenades\", ' While shooting through a window or any small hole you will notice that you do not always shoot where your crosshairs are', \" Remember to leave more space below your aim so that you don't hit the wall in front of you while you are shooting\", \" Short grass will actually disappear once you are more than 150 meters away from the grass so don't try to hide in short grass\", \" Zooming in doesn't just magnify it allows you to see as if you were actually closer\", \" So some players will appear that weren't previously visible\", ' Unlike most other shooter games PUBG has implemented a bullet drop for every gun so remember to aim high when trying to shoot longer range shots', ' Especially on guns that do not have a high range stat', ' This is again where the armory is particularly helpful', ' If you unequip all your weapons you can run much faster', ' If you do this your character will move 6', \"3 meters per second so that's a good way to measure how long it will take you to reach the safe zone\", \" If you're too far from the circle try to look for a vehicle\", ' You can usually find them along roads', ' You can use downed enemies as bait to get their teammates to come try to revive them but make sure you kill them before they reach cover', ' I personally like to put all of my guns on single fire mode', ' I find that the extra headshots more than make up for the slow rate of fire', ' If the safe zone covers the outer sea you can swim away from the shore and survive a really long time but doing this will probably make it more difficult to get first place because you have to get back to shore before you can fire your gun', \" You can't heal beyond 75% health level except when you are using med kits, energy drinks, pills or the adrenaline syringe\", ' While the crossbow and pubg looks awesome and it can one shot an unarmored enemy even with a body shot which can sometimes make it useful in the initial scramble it is actually a terrible weapon', ' It has a long reloading time and you get one shot at a time', \" The only thing that's good about this weapon is that it makes absolutely no noise\", ' Always choose a pan over other melee weapons it has higher damage and it can block bullets', ' I know this is a tip for doing better at the game but I strongly recommend checking out the Viva Lidert League YouTube channel', \" I'm pretty busy with work and family and I don't have time to watch a lot of YouTube channels but I watch and like every single pubgie video these guys make and several of their other series\", ' Just watch this one video from them and then when you fall in love with them remember that JCF was the one that sent you', \" Smoke grenades are useful for reviving a teammate or repositioning but remember to throw them quite a bit in front of the area that you were trying to cover because they don't cover the area immediately near where they land\", \" Please pay attention to your mini map even when you're using a scope to see where your enemy is shooting from\", ' Audio is really important this game since a lot of noises like opening doors, looting, healing, pulling the pen on a grenade, a thrown grenade and most footsteps do not give these notifications', ' If you are wanting to play competitively I recommend using a good headset so that you not only hear those noises but a good headset will help you identify where those noises are coming from', ' Here you have full health before getting into a fight and using painkillers and boost right before engaging an enemy is a great way to give yourself an advantage in a fight especially at the end of the game when options are the most limited', ' Wearing darker clothes like black shirt, black pants etc is best for the main map, airing out but they make you easier to spot in Miramar', ' Natural colors like yellow and gray are the best if you want to play on that map', ' Like I said earlier I almost always put my weapons on single shot but this is especially important if you are trying to shoot someone from far away because the recoil of the gun is magnified the further distance you shoot', ' When you are parachuting down use the eye icon to see how many players and teams are dropping at the same place as you', \" After you kill someone don't just stand there and loot their body that's a great way to get snipe\", ' Just grab what you can within one second and then get out', ' When you get shot at never ever ever start crawling or crouching', ' This is a very common new mistake', ' Having and crawling is helpful for hiding behind cover and not getting notice in the first place', ' They actually make you an easier target because they make you go slower', ' Always use the left fire button when using a scope because you will need your right thumb to aim', ' When you want to show your teammate where an enemy is at just move your crosshair over the enemy and then click the enemy ahead dialogue in the chat', ' Having scopes with higher magnification is always more useful than a lower one but do not equip a six time scope or higher on both of your items or it will severely weaken your close quarter combat', ' Moving silently in PUBG is a lot more difficult than rules of survival', \" So if you are playing a solo game I don't recommend staying too long in buildings\", \" Using the boost option for vehicles requires a lot more gas and creates more noise so I don't recommend using it unless you are getting shot at or trying to outrun the radiation zone\", ' When there are only two people in a car sit on the same side so the driver can position the car as a shield in combat', ' While you are swimming pay attention to your lung function', \" If it is turning red that means the game is thinking that you are still submerged in water even though your character looks like it's not\", ' Pressing crouch will let you submerge into water and jump will allow you to surface', ' If you are trying to get to the safe zone or escape an enemy fire by swimming submerging is a great way to increase your safety', ' Bullets can penetrate water but the damage is significantly reduced', ' You are also obviously harder to spot when you are underwater', ' And then lastly if you are pretty new to the game I recommend avoiding motorcycles because they can be pretty difficult to master and it is much easier for other enemies to kill you', \" Well that's it guys hope that helps\", ' Obviously compiling that was a lot of work so please remember to like this video if you did in fact like this video and if you liked it a lot can you please share it on your Facebook and Discord groups so that more people can see it', ' JCF is a pretty new channel and it really helps me grow', \" Alright guys I'll see you next time\", '']\n",

            " J.CF is short for Hugando Conforza, which is Spanish for playing with force, but is also play on words because my character's name is Forza. So I'm playing with Forza. After helping develop the Battle Royale concept for games like Armour and H1Z1, Brendan Green, known by his alias player unknown, was hired as a creative developer at Bluehole to realize his vision for the genre in his game Player Unknown's Battleground, which exploded into and is still currently considered the defining game of the genre, even though later Fortnite used 3-to-play concepts to surpass it in size and income. Today I'm going to give you 151 tips and tricks for PUBG. When you first sign up, you will be given the chance to choose a name and customize a character. A lot of players will tell you that the female character has a smaller hitbox and therefore gives you a tactical advantage, but the developers of the game have clarified that even though the girl character is smaller than the guy, the hitboxes are identical. Upon hearing this, some players will still push back saying that there might be a tactical advantage in choosing a girl because she is smaller and therefore harder to see, but since 99% of finding someone has to do with noise and camouflage levels, which are also identical between genders, these claims are at-fess and significant. After choosing your character, you will be brought to the menu screen. Before getting started, I recommend clicking on the settings button here to customize a few things. On the basic tab, enabling Amuses lets the game move the crosshairs for you a little bit, which I personally like, but it is not always helpful because enemies don't always move in the direction the game anticipates, which in those instances it can actually throw you off. Using the release option on these different firing modes gives you more precision when firing, but it also takes a while to get used to it, so I wouldn't recommend doing that unless you're an advanced player. I strongly recommend enabling peak and fire even if you're a new player because this is something you want to get good at eventually, but I wouldn't recommend selecting the whole to lean unless you're an advanced player. I keep all the other settings in this tab on their default, but it is important to note that auto-open doors can cause you to accidentally open a door at the wrong time, alerting nearby enemies to your location. In the graphics tab, setting the style the colorful will increase contrast and make it easier to see other players, and selecting a high frame rate will give your reaction time a slight advantage. This makes graphics the least important setting in this tab so it just it based on what your phone can handle. Since I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S7, which is becoming an older phone, I keep my graphics on the lowest possible setting and I keep all the other settings on default. In the controls tab, I recommend clicking the Customize button and adjusting your peak and fire buttons to be a little bit closer so you don't have to extend your thumb so far. I also recommend reducing the distance of the sprint button just a little bit and moving all of these buttons here on the right just a little bit closer to each other. Those are my favorite settings, but ultimately you need to find what works best for you. If you want to experiment with something, I recommend first trying it out in a new layout so that you can revert back to your old customized settings if you don't like it. You'll notice in my third layout that I have my shooting buttons at the top of my screen, because I bought these cool little trigger things for three bucks online from some company in China. I'm still getting the hang of them, but once I figure them out, I think having those two extra fingers will be a game changer. So if you want to try them, I'll put links to where to buy them in the description. I recommend disabling auto pickup because once you know what you're doing, it usually slows you down or crowds up your inventory. I keep all the settings on the other tabs at their default, but after you've been playing for a while, you might want to browse through them to see if you want to adjust anything. Now that we've talked about settings, let me touch briefly on the menu screen. You can customize all your game settings here, including perspective, server, modes, maps, teams, etc. Whatever you set here will be remembered and you will use those settings every time you click start. You can add friends by clicking on this button and then selecting the Add Friend tab and then typing your friend's name or character ID in this search bar. You can then invite those friends into your party using this button, but if you don't have any friends, the game will automatically select teammates for you. Joining a clan is a great way to find friends and forming a crew makes it easy to find your closest friends quickly. After you've played a few games, I recommend spending some time in the armory. The armory lets you see the stats on every single gun in the game and how that gun interacts with the various mods you can find for it. This is incredibly helpful for knowing which gun you want to keep on the battlefield. If you're free to play gamer, there are only two parts of the shop that apply to you. First one is the soldier crate. You can be bought for battle points which you get from logging in and playing the game. Missions for getting these points are either reset daily or weekly on Sunday at 6pm central standard time, which is also when the soldier crate price resets. The second one is the redeemed section. These items can be bought with the tokens you get for dismantling clothing duplicates. If you are not a free to play player, the best way to support the devs is to buy one of these elite season passes because they offer more rewards per dollar than any other offer. All of these other tabs are either not important at all or you will see a red dot when they do become important. So when you have everything set up the way you want it, click start. If you're playing on a team, the most important thing you can do is communicate with your teammates. In addition to an in game chat system, PUBG has implemented several ways to help a team communicate and work together. The first way is accessible by clicking on the mini map, this will pull up a bigger map. By clicking anywhere on this map, it will automatically set a marker that you and your teammates can see. This is helpful for a lot of reasons, but the most common thing this is used for is telling your teammates where you want to go. You can also click on this tab here which allows you to follow a teammate or invite them to follow you. This makes it really easy for your team to end up in the same place and reduces your chance of miscommunication. Lastly, if you do not want to use the voice chat, you can click the dialog button here, which gives you a ton of communication options. Some of these options have further meaning based on what you are pointing at when you use them. These in vehicles on the map are randomized each time you play, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't pay attention to where you got something, because certain places are more likely to give better weapons than others. If you get really familiar with an area, you will have a huge upper hand on someone that is just wandering around aimlessly. As a general rule, these areas have more and better loot, but most players know that, so they tend to be more heavily sought after. If you are playing a solo game, I strongly recommend avoiding these places if they are close to where the plane enters the map. All of the players are in the exact same plane as you, and most players have a tendency to exit the plane earlier. You can see which players have exited the plane by this number right here. If you are a confident player, I recommend finding one of these good locations that is off the path and marking it on your map. The maximum distance you can travel after jumping out of the plane is around 1500 meters. Some players will tell you that you can extend this distance by opening up your parachute early or slowing down your movement speed, but this is not true for PUBG Mobile, and using this approach just delays how fast you get weapons. If you are a less confident player, I recommend doing the same thing with one of these smaller groups of buildings that is off the path. There is no inertia in the game, so as soon as you jump off the plane, you can travel the opposite way of the plane just as far as if you were going with it. But I don't recommend doing that because other players that got off the plane earlier will get to the same destination faster than you, which means they will probably have guns by the time you land. As I mentioned earlier, the items are randomized, but if you find a location that has a lot of great stuff, it will probably have a lot of great stuff every time you go there. So if you are pretty new to the game, I recommend going to the same place as much as you can to get really familiar with it, which will give you a huge advantage over other players that aren't as familiar with that area. After the plane leaves the island, a safe zone will appear. It will be a circle covering about a third of the island, and a timer will start with 5 minutes. When this timer runs out, a radiation zone will start closing in on that circle. The radiation zone wall moves slower or faster, based on how far it is to the closest edge of the new circle. This means that if you are far away from the circle, the radiation zone travels significantly faster than you can run. The process of the radiation zone shrinking the first time also takes exactly 5 minutes. At this point, a new safe zone appears, and the process repeats itself for a total of 9 phases. Here are the main stats on each of these phases. For those of you who have been playing for a while, these numbers may not seem that important, but now that you know them, you will be surprised how often this knowledge will affect your decisions. Knowing details about what is going on around you in a game can often increase confidence and reduce indecisiveness. In the beginning, you don't have to worry that much about the radiation zone because it only does 0.4 damage per second. But this damage increases each round, so by the time you get to the end of the game, the radiation zone does 11 damage per second, which makes it incredibly important to be in the safe zone. For those of you who are used to playing rules of survival where you can spend the first half of the game in the radiation zone, you will find this much more difficult to do in PUBG. As soon as you land, find a gun with ammo as quickly as possible. People can tell when you don't have a gun and they will chase you mercilessly until you are dead. Once you have a gun, I recommend searching for a rifle and ammo. SMGs are a much better option than they were in rules of survival, but having a rifle is one of your weapons is still really important. Even what your average bullet per kill ratio is, and then unless you have a really nice backpack stop gathering ammo after you have enough to kill 8 people. I promise that by the time you've killed those 8 people you will have found more ammo. If you see the shooting icon, don't assume they're shooting at you, but look around to see if you can find them. If you see them and they don't see you, don't attack them unless it's an easy kill. Long battles attract a lot of attention and should be avoided. Stay near buildings so that if you start taking damage and you don't see them, you can just run around a corner to buy you some time and set up if they chase you. Now if you're still in bronze, most of the players you will be fighting are AI players, which are really easy to kill. Do not let this easy competition make you develop bad habits. Try to always fight from a position where you have cover and if you don't have cover, try to get in the habit of moving while you shoot so that you do not become an easy target. Even if the player you're shooting does not see you start moving within 2 seconds after first firing your gun because if you shoot at someone while you are not in cover, it will likely attract the attention of someone else nearby and standing in the middle of the field will get you killed really quickly. So get in the habit of moving while you shoot every time you engage when you don't have cover to hide behind. If you're playing a team game, the most important thing you can do in the very early stage is stay close enough to your teammates so that you can support each other while you're looking for items. If you're playing competitively then you should have a good team and if you have a good team, then you should live or die as a team. Playing 3 vs 4 in a competitive game is stupid, especially because it's so easy to avoid. You also want to be on the lookout for good armor, helmets and backpacks. Level 3 items are the best in the game but they are also rare. Level 2 items are attainable but don't spend too much time trying to get all level 2 pieces. You can see what level your gear is from how many bars are here. Once you have some decent gear, you have several options on what to do next. PUBG is a multifaceted game. You get points for killing people, doing damage, getting supplies, surviving the longest and even get points for taking damage and then healing yourself. This gives you lots of options on how to play this game. If you want to know the 4 main strategies for how people play PUBG, I recommend checking out my video that lays out the pros and cons of all 4 of them. The only tactic that I don't mention in that video is the car rampage tactic. Using a car is your weapon is very effective. So much so that there are some players that are able to win solo games without ever shooting a gun. That tactic is a great option as is all the tactics I mentioned in that video and if you're going for points you should do whichever one best fits your strengths as a player. But in this video I'm going to be focusing on how to get first place. PUBG is not just a shooter game. You can be fun to play it that way and you still get lots of points doing it but if you want to get first place often you have to get out of that mentality. PUBG is also a survival game. Shooting a gun attracts attention and attention is a great way to die. If I see someone and they don't see me but I'm not in a good enough position to kill them and take on someone else that hears me kill them I just let them go. In fact if I'm really playing competitive like I'm trying to get first place every time I often just watch people for most of the game and only kill when I really have a good read on where everyone is at. The best place to hide is in tall grass on high ground near a rock or tree. For those of you who saw my rules of survival video my tactic where I hide in one of these little sheds with a shotgun is not nearly as effective in PUBG because it's not as easy to one shot someone so I seldom use this tactic when I'm playing PUBG. I still love using shotguns and I see a lot of pros use them in urban combat but I don't use the shed tactic. Now when you're part of a team there's no reason to hide because a well-positioned team that works well together can kill dozens of players without ever receiving a single casualty. The team simply has to make sure that they position themselves in a place that they can fight in any direction with little to moderate repositioning. They also need to make sure that they are close enough to each other that they can revive downed enemies without being exposed. The team that works well together under those conditions is almost invincible. A solo person however is not especially in PUBG. A lot of players are really good with a car 98 so drawing too much attention can be the end even if you're a really good player. If you are pushing hard for the first place position I recommend using one of these two tactics. If you find that you are already in the new safe zone when it appears I recommend staying in your hiding place for as long as you can. Look around to see where people are but don't kill anyone unless you are confident that you can kill them within 2 seconds of first firing your gun. Look at them if they are close but be super wary of other enemies since you just fired your gun. Even firing a gun with a suppressor will still alert enemies if they are close enough. In a team game if you shoot someone and they die without getting knocked down first then that means that all of their teammates are already dead. But if they get knocked down first instead of dying that means that at least one of their teammates is still alive and the guy you just knocked down can communicate your position to his teammates even after you kill him. So you want to kill him as soon as possible so his teammates don't revive him but you also want to be cautious when it happens and stick close to your teammates. It is incredibly hard for someone to see you when you are crawling in the grass if you are on high ground. But if you are on lower ground than them high grass is almost worthless. If you are on high ground and stay still people should not be able to see you unless you are within 7 meters or closer. If you find yourself outside of the new safe zone when it appears I recommend waiting as long as possible. You can run from cover to cover if you are careful to look around while you do it but I recommend giving other players a chance to get to the safe zone first. This might seem like horrible advice because a lot of players talk about killing people as they run to the safe zone but once you try it a couple times you will notice that that happens rarely. In PUBG most players die when an enemy notices them first. That enemy then fires at them when they are in bad position and they have very little chance of winning the fight. By letting other players go first you will find that you often see other players before they see you. In fact most of them will never see you because their back is turned to you most of the time as they run to safety. Usually by the end everyone is calling around at a field and behind cover and it is very hard to see them. If you are part of a team and there are no buildings in the safe zone I recommend spreading out about 4 to 8 meters from each other. This makes you close enough to support each other but far enough away that enemies will probably only see one of you at a time. If you are playing solo stay hidden as long as possible. Remember this tutorial is about getting first place so ideally you only have to kill one person to win but the closer you get to the end the harder it is to not run into someone. When you see someone get close kill them while you still have the advantage of shooting first then slowly crawl away from your kill while looking around because the loot box is noticeable from a distance and your enemies will likely be looking for you to loot your kill. When you are down to the last two the safe zone is usually pretty small right now. I am not very good at throwing grenades so I have usually saved up about 5 or more grenades at this point. If you see the other guy but they are in cover chunk all of your grenades at them. Remember to wait a second or two before throwing it so they don't have as much time to run away but obviously don't wait 3 seconds or you will be giving them an easy win. Even the more likely scenario you do not see them but the safe zone is very small I recommend throwing one of your grenades at every tree and rock that is in the safe zone. This is kind of a controversial tactic because if they are close enough they can hear you pull the pin on your grenade and if they are watching they will either see you or the grenade in the air which will let them get an idea for where you are at. And I agree with those objections in theory but in practice I find that this tactic almost always works out to your favorite because the grenades usually get people to come out of their cover or reveal where they are and I only do this when I have a really good position. So in my experience it either works or they weren't in cover because they were crawling on the grass and it doesn't seem to have an effect either way. So I recommend trying it out for yourself and see if you can land the first place spot. In addition to those 99 tips and tricks I have 52 more for you. There seems to be a lot of confusion even among advanced players on how boost items work. I hear a lot of people say that energy drinks give you movement speed but painkillers do not. That is not true. Energy items do not give you any benefits in and of themselves. Rather they give you points towards your boost meter and your boost meter gives you benefits. It's important to think this way because if you don't you will get confused. There are very advanced websites out there that say things like energy drinks will restore 23% of your health. That is not true. If you use an energy drink well it can heal up to 52% of your health. Here's how the boost system works. When you use a boost item it gives you a percentage of your boost meter which diminishes over time. This meter consists of a total of 5 minutes. Energy drinks give you 40% of that meter which is equal to 2 minutes. Energy drinks will give you 60% which is equal to 3 minutes and the adrenaline syringe gives you 100% which covers the whole 5 minutes. You get different benefits based on how much boost you have in your boost meter. So using an energy drink by itself actually only heals 22% of your health. But that is not the best way to use an energy drink. If you use a painkiller and then an energy drink that same energy drink will heal 52% of your health and give you a move in speed bonus of either 2.5 or 6.2% based on which bar you are on. And then after 2 minutes when your bar drops back down to 60%. You can use another energy drink to get another 52% of your health back and have another move in speed bonus. So that's how the boost system works in PUBG. If you want to know more about my strategy on how to maximize this system to your advantage be sure to check out my video titled How to get double healing from energy drinks. To just recently added the flare gun into the game you need to aim towards the sky in order to use it. Using it outside the safe zone will spawn an armored vehicle and using it inside the safe zone will spawn a special air drop with twice the normal loot. The developers never actually added infrastructure to these towers so you cannot land on them no matter how hard you try. But there is a way to use the lean function to get a little bit up this tower. While clearing a house or going around a corner you can use your third person camera to peek around the other side which is an effective way to stay safe while scouting. While driving a vehicle you can see its health and fuel bar shown here. You can also tell when one of your tires has been destroyed because the corresponding icon will turn red. Peek as much as you can even when you're in a house but remember that staying inside a house can sometimes become a death trap if you are up against a player who is skilled with grenades. While shooting through a window or any small hole you will notice that you do not always shoot where your crosshairs are. Remember to leave more space below your aim so that you don't hit the wall in front of you while you are shooting. Short grass will actually disappear once you are more than 150 meters away from the grass so don't try to hide in short grass. Zooming in doesn't just magnify it allows you to see as if you were actually closer. So some players will appear that weren't previously visible. Unlike most other shooter games PUBG has implemented a bullet drop for every gun so remember to aim high when trying to shoot longer range shots. Especially on guns that do not have a high range stat. This is again where the armory is particularly helpful. If you unequip all your weapons you can run much faster. If you do this your character will move 6.3 meters per second so that's a good way to measure how long it will take you to reach the safe zone. If you're too far from the circle try to look for a vehicle. You can usually find them along roads. You can use downed enemies as bait to get their teammates to come try to revive them but make sure you kill them before they reach cover. I personally like to put all of my guns on single fire mode. I find that the extra headshots more than make up for the slow rate of fire. If the safe zone covers the outer sea you can swim away from the shore and survive a really long time but doing this will probably make it more difficult to get first place because you have to get back to shore before you can fire your gun. You can't heal beyond 75% health level except when you are using med kits, energy drinks, pills or the adrenaline syringe. While the crossbow and pubg looks awesome and it can one shot an unarmored enemy even with a body shot which can sometimes make it useful in the initial scramble it is actually a terrible weapon. It has a long reloading time and you get one shot at a time. The only thing that's good about this weapon is that it makes absolutely no noise. Always choose a pan over other melee weapons it has higher damage and it can block bullets. I know this is a tip for doing better at the game but I strongly recommend checking out the Viva Lidert League YouTube channel. I'm pretty busy with work and family and I don't have time to watch a lot of YouTube channels but I watch and like every single pubgie video these guys make and several of their other series. Just watch this one video from them and then when you fall in love with them remember that JCF was the one that sent you. Smoke grenades are useful for reviving a teammate or repositioning but remember to throw them quite a bit in front of the area that you were trying to cover because they don't cover the area immediately near where they land. Please pay attention to your mini map even when you're using a scope to see where your enemy is shooting from. Audio is really important this game since a lot of noises like opening doors, looting, healing, pulling the pen on a grenade, a thrown grenade and most footsteps do not give these notifications. If you are wanting to play competitively I recommend using a good headset so that you not only hear those noises but a good headset will help you identify where those noises are coming from. Here you have full health before getting into a fight and using painkillers and boost right before engaging an enemy is a great way to give yourself an advantage in a fight especially at the end of the game when options are the most limited. Wearing darker clothes like black shirt, black pants etc is best for the main map, airing out but they make you easier to spot in Miramar. Natural colors like yellow and gray are the best if you want to play on that map. Like I said earlier I almost always put my weapons on single shot but this is especially important if you are trying to shoot someone from far away because the recoil of the gun is magnified the further distance you shoot. When you are parachuting down use the eye icon to see how many players and teams are dropping at the same place as you. After you kill someone don't just stand there and loot their body that's a great way to get snipe. Just grab what you can within one second and then get out. When you get shot at never ever ever start crawling or crouching. This is a very common new mistake. Having and crawling is helpful for hiding behind cover and not getting notice in the first place. They actually make you an easier target because they make you go slower. Always use the left fire button when using a scope because you will need your right thumb to aim. When you want to show your teammate where an enemy is at just move your crosshair over the enemy and then click the enemy ahead dialogue in the chat. Having scopes with higher magnification is always more useful than a lower one but do not equip a six time scope or higher on both of your items or it will severely weaken your close quarter combat. Moving silently in PUBG is a lot more difficult than rules of survival. So if you are playing a solo game I don't recommend staying too long in buildings. Using the boost option for vehicles requires a lot more gas and creates more noise so I don't recommend using it unless you are getting shot at or trying to outrun the radiation zone. When there are only two people in a car sit on the same side so the driver can position the car as a shield in combat. While you are swimming pay attention to your lung function. If it is turning red that means the game is thinking that you are still submerged in water even though your character looks like it's not. Pressing crouch will let you submerge into water and jump will allow you to surface. If you are trying to get to the safe zone or escape an enemy fire by swimming submerging is a great way to increase your safety. Bullets can penetrate water but the damage is significantly reduced. You are also obviously harder to spot when you are underwater. And then lastly if you are pretty new to the game I recommend avoiding motorcycles because they can be pretty difficult to master and it is much easier for other enemies to kill you. Well that's it guys hope that helps. Obviously compiling that was a lot of work so please remember to like this video if you did in fact like this video and if you liked it a lot can you please share it on your Facebook and Discord groups so that more people can see it. JCF is a pretty new channel and it really helps me grow. Alright guys I'll see you next time.\n"
